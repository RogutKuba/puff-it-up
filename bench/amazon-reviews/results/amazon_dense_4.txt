QUERY: countertop dishwasher with fruit and vegetable wash cycle
======================================================================
[Latency: 254.1ms]

#1 [★★★★★]  (sim: 0.640)
   "Say bye bye to hand washing dishes"
   If you are living in an apartment and don't have a dishwasher you might want to check this out. This is designed to sit on the countertop, draws its water source from the faucet via a included hose, and drains into the sink via provided hose. It plugs into a regular 110v outlet.<br /><br />This unit also has a fruits and veg washing setting which I found pretty interesting!  Remember to clean your filter each use.<br /><br />I wl update as the appliance gets more use

#2 [★★★★★]  (sim: 0.631)
   "Wonderful"
   This portable dishwasher is amazing. Perfect for small spaces it is simple to set up and use. It does a terrific job. There are a number of settings: normal, rapid, fruit, steam and glass. ,The fruit option insures your produce is free of dirt. No detergent needed for this cycle.  It uses powdered dishwasher detergent or those dishwasher tabs. The capacity is small but it saves you from running the full sized washer. It is portable and ideal for rvs or camping. My kitchen isa disaster due to a pandemic interrupted andcpostponed rennovation. This countertop appliance makes life easier.

   "Saving water & time."
   We originally uses a lot of water just to wash a few dishes, but this helps us save water and time! This counter top dishwasher is a perfect household essential item.

#4 [★★★★★]  (sim: 0.582)
   "Small Space Help"
   This small dishwasher is ideal for small spaces. Set up was straightforward, not easy but not difficult either. It is reasonably quiet and simple to use. I use pods or tablets. It is a compact unit. If you spend a week waiting to have a full load, this is for you. One of my brothers loves the fruit/veggie washing function.  It handles standard sizes, ie., ten inch dinner plates, regular cups, but nothing extra large. Pleased so far.

   "It works 30MIN clean cycle, easy setup"
   I bought this one as it is a bit smaller and would fit better in my kitchen. The packaging was well with no damage. I like the fact you do not have to have it hooked up to the sink, I was worried of having a leak, especially if I was not at home, or being able to use my sink normally without the hoses in the way.  To use I turn it on, select setting, hit start, and use my sink sprayer to fill it up, "no mess that way", and when it's full it beeps and starts up. The quick wash cycle works just fine, so about 30min and dishes are done!

QUERY: ice maker makes nugget ice pebble style like Sonic
======================================================================
[Latency: 60.6ms]

#1 [★★★★★]  (sim: 0.682)
   "Outstanding"
   This is a great addition to any kitchen, especially if you don't have an ice-maker in the freezer. Setting it up is simple, as is the initial cleaning (it mostly self-cleans). The ice it produces is perfect: smaller, cylindrical cubes that are not overly-solid. It is like the ice you would find at Sonic and some other fast food places. It makes ice quickly and always keeps the drawer full. It's just great.

#2 [★★★★☆]  (sim: 0.677)
   "Nuggets"
   This ice maker is easy to use. It is fairly quiet and very efficient. It makes nugget ice. The cubes are small, soft and chewable. No odd taste. It recycles melted ice and is simple to clean. Working well so far.

#3 [★★★★☆]  (sim: 0.656)
   "Efficient"
   This ice maker is compact. It is easy to set up and use. It is quick and not too noisy. The nugget style cubes are chewable. There are two sizes, small and large but the size difference is negligible. It has performed consistently.

#4 [★★★★☆]  (sim: 0.648)
   "Makes great ice, super easy to install"
   Pros:<br />-Makes great ice<br />-Super easy to set up, no water line needed<br />-Easy to fill and clean<br />-Low energy drain (average 70 watts while making ice, 1 watt on standby)<br /><br />Cons:<br />-Loud during ice making<br />-Designed to fit under kitchen cabinets but we tried it in 2 kitchens and it was slightly too tall in both cases (around .25-.5 inch too tall)<br />-Proprietary filter is pretty expensive and I don't expect it to last long based on how small it is<br /><br />If you are looking for an ice maker to give you the 'good ice' you find at many restaurants and fast-food places like Sonic and Chick-fil-a.. from what I can tell this is the only consumer-grade machine that makes true nugget-style ice.  In my opinion the ice this machine makes it not quite as good as that of commercial ice makers because the nugget size is slightly bigger.. but it gets very close at a fraction of the price of a decent commercial machine.<br /><br />My parents have had a manitowoc commercial ice maker for around 20 years now and I have always wanted one myself but was never able to justify spending several thousand dollars on an ice maker.. not to mention the water line and space needed to fit a commercial machine.  So I was excited when I learned about the Opal bringing this kind of ice to a smaller countertop form-factor.  While it isn't perfect, overall I have been happy with the machine and would definitely recommend it to those who are obsessed with 'good ice'.

   "Don't Waste Your Money!"
   We really like nugget ice, so much that we would buy bags of it from Sonic, so we were excited to find the Opal Counter Top Nugget Ice Maker. It was awesome - made great, soft, nugget ice just like it was supposed to - until it didn't. Exactly one year and two weeks after purchase (right after the one-year warranty), it stopped making ice. We tried all of the trouble-shooting - reset it, unplug it and wait a few hours, clean with vinegar, check the water lines. Nothing helped. It will make about a tablespoon of ice and then quit. Disappointing that a $580 appliance is only good for one year (and two weeks). If you want to pay an average of $50/month for the good ice for about a year, go for it. Just don't be surprised when it breaks.<br /><br />Don't be fooled by all of the 5-star reviews. I would have given it a 5-star review as well for the first 12 months. Check out all of the 1-star reviews - plenty of other folks have had the same experience.

We chose to use it unvented at this time but we can always vent it later if we decide to ramp up our cooking.  The only downside that I see is that it doesn't include the duct  work for the vent.  However, the duct work is bulky and has to be designed to fit the installation.  There is an adapter for both square and round ducts included in the box.

   This is a very powerful and elegant range hood, excellent suction and illumination; it is also very good-looking.<br />On the cons side I have to say that it is a bit heavy and challenging to install.<br />Overall I am very satisfied about Chef 30” PS18 Under Cabinet Range Hood.

   "Collapsible Silicone Coffee Drip / Pour Over"
   I got this because I am a coffee addict and needed to make sure I have access to brewing fresh coffee at work. This fits over my mug, uses small sized cone filters and lets me do a pour-over with fresh ground beans that I bring with me (my bottom desk drawer looks like Starbucks). Cleans easily, folds flat. An awesome purchase. I am never without.

   "Tiny and cute, makes great coffee for one, with patience"
   Shown is the glass dripper with the companion Kalita Carafe. An eleven ounce mug is shown for scale.<br /><br />It’s great for making one mug of coffee, but you have to be careful, slow, and patient. The carafe helps a lot because you can see by the markings exactly how much coffee is coming out.<br /><br />I also have the matching metal dripper which is great for travel.<br /><br />Drawbacks would be how easy it is to overflow the tiny paper filter all over and make a huge mess of wet coffee grinds, so there is no shortcut to standing there slowing pouring the hot water. Would be better for someone who likes it weak and would use less ground coffee.

#3 [★★★★★] ✓ Verified (sim: 0.590)
   "Filters well with pour-overs"
   Works quite well in filtering coffee grinds from your cup. I use this to brew my morning pour over and while it isn't as tasty as a metal filter, it also provides a bean free cup of coffee. Fits well in the hario holders as well as chemex (and similar) coffee pots.

#4 [★★★★★] ✓ Verified (sim: 0.588)
   "Best coffee maker (cone) I have ever found"
   This is one of the best things for making coffee.  It fits in ALL of my thermal carafes, there may be some it doesn't but it has worked in all of mine.  It is more narrow than other drip coffee filters which makes a little stronger brew.  I have no idea why it works that way but it does. I use the size 6 coffee filters.  Yes you have to heat the water separately but, for me, it is worth it.  There is a rather zen thing about it all.<br /><br />Plus, you get to buy the carafe(s) you want so you can get a cool carafe.  I really can't recommend this simple thing high enough.  If you are a coffee nerd as opposed to a hipster -- just relax for 5 minutes and make better coffee.  Well that really is enough about that!

#5 [★★★★★] ✓ Verified (sim: 0.588)
   "Ridiculously Easy to use"
   A foolproof cup of coffee every time. Steady drip-rate ensures a consistent brew every time. Just make sure you use a medium grind for whole beans. 4 scoops/tablespoons of coffee grinds to fill a 500ml carafe sitting below the Bee House Ceramic Coffe Dripper (Large) works very well for my morning cup(s) of coffee. You will need the Melitta #2 coffee filters which are available at local stores for very little $. Highly recommend this pour-over dripper vs the Hario V60.

   "Fits the food showcase french door fridge perfectly"
   Bought this for my Samsung model  RF28JBEDBSG food showcase French door refrigerator.  Be sure to turn the water line valve off before removing your current filter, then remove & replace it with this new one.  Run several glasses of water through it after you install it to clear the line of air and remove any fine particles from the filter and you'll have clean clear water and ice cubes for another six months.

   I wasn’t sure this was the correct filter for our fridge but I looked it up online and these ended up working perfectly. I have included the model, serial and compression numbers in the photos in the hope that it will help someone. Just twist and pull the old filter out and then push and twist the new one in. Very Easy! The filter hole is in between the fruit and vegetable drawers.<br />  I read that there are a few ways to get the red filter light to go off after replacing the filter. I held the alarm button for 3-5 secs. You can also hold the water button 3-5 secs.<br />  We have well water and do not drink it due to the taste but the water tasted completely different with this filter and I would absolutely use the water out of the fridge after installing this filter.

   "Filtered water. Not rocket science."
   If you have a Samsung fridge like we do, then you need to use their filter. There's not much you can say about this thingie. We're not heavy thru-the-door water drinkers, but it's nice to know the option to filter the water is there. I figure we get 5-6 months out of one (less during the summer months). I think it's pricey for what it does, but it is what it is. Sorry to be cliche, but it's not like you have an option of going with a superior brand for less money.

   "Love My Dishwasher!!!"
   [[VIDEOID:c3129c938af76c70b7ae0fc3ee13ea57]] This ICUIRE Portable Dishwasher is fabulous. We tried to hook it to our kitchen faucet but neither the male or female set up fit, so we are using the bucket method, which is super easy. I just have to keep an eye on the water level during the inflow but other than that, go about your business and come back to sparkling clean dishes, glasses and silverware. The noise level is minimal. This dishwasher is so easy to use that we looked at the booklet one time and that was all we needed. I do wish the heated dry cycle was shorter because it is 60 minutes no matter what cycle you run the dishwasher on. Our kitchen was not built with room for a regular dishwasher and I was so tired of hand washing. This ICUIRE Portable Dishwasher is the best gift I have given myself. Worth every cent, in my opinion. I have it on a cart with wheels and bring it to my sink when it's time to do dishes. Easy Peasy. Fantastic product found on Amazon.

   "Not so compact, but works."
   I've used portable dishwashers before and they are AWESOME for people who travel or have dietary restrictions (Kosher, for example, need separate washers for milk and meat dishes). The good news is, this actually seems like it does a decent job and even comes with some complimentary detergent and jet dry in the box, so you can get up and running right away... in some cases, at least. I say that because depending on how you hook it up, you may need additional hardware to connect to your water lines and/or sink.<br />Here's my problem with it- they claim it is a "countertop" style washer, but the thing is actually too big for my counter! I don't have enough clearance under the cabinets to fit, and it has a lot of hoses and tubing to connect as well. I was considering drilling into my counter to feed the tubes to the water supply and drain, but decided to try connecting to the sink instead when we saw it wasn't fitting well under the cabinets. But then it is too close to the sink and with the hoses etc connected, it looks like it is taking over the kitchen more than just an appliance on the counter like a toaster.<br />I've seen smaller counter-top dishwashers that would easily fit better in our space. Perhaps this one does a better job, but at this point I feel like it is too big to fit the way I intended to use it, but too small to be one we install permanently in the cabinet space. Perhaps someone else will find this size useful, I'm a little disappointed because I was so excited for this to work.

   This is a terrific little icemaker. Set up was simple and it is easy to use. Watching the process through the clear top window is fun, but then again I'm entertained by watching compressed mattresses puff up. In any event there are two options small cubes or large. It is efficient and not too noisy. The ice tastes good and clean, no funky plastic taste. There are indicators that let you know when to add water or when to remove the ice. It is compact and works very well.

   This is a great little ice maker. Sleek and compact it is easy to use. It has no freezing capacity. You must remove the cubes or they will melt and be recycled to ice cube state again. Included is a basket and scoop to help make transfer simple. The cubes are small, bullet shaped pieces. They taste fine. The viewing window is fun. I am amazed at how quiet this machine is. Handy and fun.

   "Makes good ice"
   This machine makes "bar quality" ice very fast. The ice is mostly clear. It drops 9 cubes about every 10 minutes, give or take a minute. It has a good size reservoir for water. You'll get at least 3 bins of ice for every refill. Cleanup is easy. It outpaces my other under-counter bar ice maker; of a well known name, and the noise level is about half that of the under-counter bar ice maker. Ice melt recycles if you do not empty the bin. Which my under-counter model just wastes. It will automatically stop when the bin is full. One word of caution. This goes for every "bar ice type" maker. Do NOT put the ice into your freezer. It will simply freeze into a big wad of ice. If you need to keep a quantity of ice then just put it into something like a styrofoam chest. All of the ice will remain as separate cubes.

   Although the ice maker was shown as compact I really felt that it was compact but still too high and it weighed about 40 pounds ( that was a surprise). The ice was never clear and at times the cubes were not fully formed, it was disappointing to me. By the time I placed them in my ice tea the ice would melt into the drink quickly because they were melty when made. IMelty?

   "Buyer Beware!"
   Buyer Beware!<br /><br />Purchased this range hood in January 2014, it worked fine for about a year and looked good (although there's no way it's really working at 900CFM, btw). It suddenly began malfunctioning -- randomly changing fan speeds, refusing to turn off or on, lights turning off and on randomly. I had to start controlling it at the breaker box, which is very inconvenient since my overhead kitchen lights are on the same circuit. After about a month, it stopped working at all even when the breaker is on. At least I can use my overhead lights now!<br /><br />It's still under the 3 year parts warranty and I've sent 2 emails to the manufacturer, Golden Vantage, and haven't received any response.I'll update if I hear from them.

   "Nice Look"
   Over all, I'm happy with this purchase. I have a very out-dated and standard kitchen. This hood really looks nice and adds a modern feel to the kitchen. When I do re-model, this range hood is staying because I believe it will look good with any type of cabinets, wall colors etc.<br />The installation wasn't exactly easy. The provided instructions are pretty much useless. I had to run electric to the proper area since my kitchen did not have any type of exhaust over the range in the past. For now, I'm using it in the vent-less mode. I plan on running the vent through the attic and to a roof vent. This will wait for nicer weather. I dented the stainless extension in the process of removing the protective film, be careful with this. The film is stuck on pretty good, comes off in one piece but you really gotta pull so be careful how you are holding the stainless. My installation with electric took about 4 hours, keep in mind I haven't installed the ext. vent as of yet.<br />I like the led lights and the fan isn't terribly loud. The power off button has about a 1 minute delay, not the 2 to 3 minutes as the booklet suggests. It would be nice to have the option for a longer delay, like 10 minutes.
