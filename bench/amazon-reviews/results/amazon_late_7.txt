   "Portable ice maker for your countertop"
   Great ice maker for the money. If your planning a party or just want some extra ice, this will do the job. It does require that you add water to start the cycle and when it's full, you have to use it or bag it, but I can live with that. The only problem is that it doesn't store ice. If the basket has ice in it, and you turn it off, the ice will melt back to water.

   I purchased the dishwasher 1 month ago to replace a Kenmore dishwasher.<br />Pros: The dishwasher is very well constructed. The fill, rinse and wash cycles are very quiet. The dishes come out clean with no water spots. Thee dishwasher uses a combination of a very hot rinse cycle and Rinse Aid which results in dry spot free dishes.<br />Cons: None

   "Huzzah!  Calcium deposits and streaks FIXED with PowerHouse"
   I was about to get rid of my old dishwasher because I couldn't stand the calcium deposits and streaks on all of my dishes, but especially the glass and stainless steel.  And then my daughter purchased this from a dollar store, and when I started putting away dishes one night after we'd used it...I was STUNNED.  The glasses were squeaky clean--no white streaks or splotches.  The utensils and cutlery and pots and pans were glistening, for the first time in ages.  I don't know what's in this stuff, but I don't have to use vinegar or any of the commercial "dishwasher refreshers" on the market.  It took care of the deposits that were gunking up my dishwasher and dishes, and I am absolutely astounded at the difference it has made.  Now, I don't have to wipe off or rewash everything before I put them on the shelves.  This stuff is amazing!

   "Works Great, But Makes Loud Popping Noises"
   Worked flawlessly for a few weeks, but have had this unit for several months now, and unit makes frequent loud banging or pop noises. Apparently this is normal, and part of the defroster or something. Not very happy because the popping has awakened my wife and I in the middle of the night. I have no other place to put it, or I would move it out of our bedroom, which was the whole reason I bought it in the first place.<br /><br />Other than the noise, the fridge works great, has a lot of room, and doesn't build up any ice in the freezer compartment. I would recommend this frige to those who are very soumd sleepers, or for people who won't be using it in the bedroom, or other sleeping areas.

   "Best refrigerator ever"
   We’ve owned this refrigerator for 16 months and it is by far the best refrigerator we have ever owned. It does what you would expect from a $3,000 refrigerator like keeping everything cold but we are extremely pleased that it doesn’t have any of the problems we’ve had with other refrigerators like Samsung. It is extremely quiet which is important to us since it’s located in a kitchen/living room combination room—the Samsung we had before was at times so loud we had to turn up the volume on the living room TV. It makes an abundance of ice cubes without freezing them into clumps and jamming the dispenser and it dispenses ice without it flying everywhere. The ice tray is easy to access and remove. The middle drawer is spacious for storing drinks and having ready access to other regular use items like cheese, cold cuts and yogurt. The door-in-door is great for quickly grabbing items without having to open the main compartment—we use it for eggs, butter, creamer, salad dressing and water and wine carafes. The bottom freezer is large with an upper drawer and lower compartment. The French doors and middle and freezer drawers are a bit heavy so it takes a little more than a gentle push to close them but that’s a minor issue considering how great the refrigerator performs.

   I bought the retro fridge and now purchased this to match.  Its not overly loud but it does make a small amount of noise, nothing that is overly distracting.  Pumps out the ice rather quickly.  Still one month in, will circle back here with another review after a few months.

   Since  installing, my freezer no longer needs to be defrosted every week.  Installed on a Maytag Refrigerator.<br />Maytag should have done a recall, as the small rubber gasket was always freezing up, I found out about this product by &#34;google searching&#34;<br />why my frost free freezer always needed defrosting.  I highly recommend this item for others who may be having freezer freezing up issues.<br />This part saved me from having to buy a new refrigerator/freezer, and or calling for a repair man.

   "Defrosting again!"
   My GE top freezer GTS22JBPCRWW friege is once again defrosting perfectly, thanks to replacing the old  fan with this one.  This model of GE , I've found on repair sites, has a fan that tends to wear out after several years.  This is a fairly easy repair if you're at all handy with appliance repairs.<br />FYI, if your fridge (at least this model) is cooling and freezing normally, and the defrost cycle is running normally, but you've got ice building up in the freezer, including frozen droplets of water hanging from the top of the freezer compartment  and heavy frost buildup on your frozen stuff - it's probably the freezer fan.  The fan is not running fast enough to evaporate the water, which then refreezes.  This is a very reasonably priced fix for an expensive fridge.

   "Truly an outstanding coffee maker!"
   I have used many a coffee maker, Chemex's, Moka Pot's, French Presses, and Siphon styles. This may not be quite my favorite as the Siphon, but it is excellent. I thought when I got it "This has got to be overhyped, it's just a thick plastic-y thing!" but it really is as good as people say. Looks are deceiving. It is wonderful to use, and dead simple. Put your filter in, put the grounds in, put the water in, stir it a bit, put the plunger on, and plunge. It makes excellent coffee, very full bodied, but still with good clarity due to the paper filter. Absolutely no sediment at the bottom of the cup either! Clean up is a breeze, just take the filter holder off, and pop the filter and most of the grounds out with the plunger, rinse, and it's clean. It's so simple and easy, absolutely zero fuss! I recommend this maker for anyone wanting for a quick and easy to clean maker, or for getting into manual coffee making. It requires very little skill, but it has alot you can do, so you'll never truly master it. I bought one, and recommended it highly enough that a friend of mine did too.

   "Laundry Alternative works well for me!!"
   The Laundry Alternative machine is a cute product and I love the mint green color! It is performing well for me as it does laundry.  Takes small amount of detergent, (or softener); operates by turning a level to spin tub around on its stand.  Instructions provided which suggest minutes to spin, alternating front & back spins, based on load size.<br /><br />If your wash load is only lightly dirty you can remove that load and put aside for rinsing and place another load in your Laundry Alternative and proceed with washing process in the same detergent.  This will save on your water bill and detergent as well.<br /><br />Following the washing cycle I use a spin machine that removes excess water; therefore, eliminating having to use hands to squeeze water out of each piece.<br /><br />Time it takes clothes to dry after hanging up is surprisingly short, especially on a sunny day.<br /><br />I hope you enjoy your new Laundry Alternative as much as I do! IMO the<br />whole process of using the Laundry Alternative isn’t lengthy and it saves money.

   range hood looks very good...suction is strong, on the lowest setting its already stronger than the range/microwave that came with the house on the strongest setting...<br /><br />installation was painful though...if only they had a way to make it easier to get to the holes a that are in the back corner...template helps a lot but in the end it is still very difficult to get to those corner holes

   "Quiet and efficient! Looks great!"
   Such an improvement! We replaced an old 42" vented hood.  It took less than an hour!<br />This model is convertible for either vented or not and has access panels for the vent on the top and the back.  We ordered one and it arrived all dented. It was replaced and we're very happy with this one. It has great suction, is quiet and the black finish is easy to clean.

   This is a very powerful range hood. It is rather noisy, but it does its job. It does allow cold air seepage during the winter, which I was not used to as I had had a Jenn-Aire stove with a downdraft vent.

   "Compact and Convenient Dishwasher"
   This is an excellent compact dishwasher that is perfect for a small space. It is about the size of a large microwave. I found that it is light enough for one person to maneuver, but it's easier with two people. It has a good capacity for such a compact unit. It's easy to operate and comes with a power cord and connection hoses. It's likely that you'll have to purchase an additional adapter to fit your faucet.<br /><br />The dishwasher looks nice and operates with minimal noise.

   "Wonderful"
   This portable dishwasher is amazing. Perfect for small spaces it is simple to set up and use. It does a terrific job. There are a number of settings: normal, rapid, fruit, steam and glass. ,The fruit option insures your produce is free of dirt. No detergent needed for this cycle.  It uses powdered dishwasher detergent or those dishwasher tabs. The capacity is small but it saves you from running the full sized washer. It is portable and ideal for rvs or camping. My kitchen isa disaster due to a pandemic interrupted andcpostponed rennovation. This countertop appliance makes life easier.

   This does make new ice pretty fast and takes up very little counter space. The only reason for 4 out 5 stars is that the ice tends to melt kind of fast.  I've double checked to make sure everything is closed on the machine, and that it's not too close to the wall or anything else.

   Makes ice fast, and I have very little trouble with it. I only wish it has a timer built into it, so I could shut it off at a certain time, then have it start making ice again at a certain time.<br /><br />To reduce the number of times you have to clean the unit, use distilled water. This will also make your ice cubes crystal clear.

   This machine is very handy when we entertain friends and family. It makes ice cubes quickly in two sizes, small and large in under 20 minutes. The large ice cube size is actually average size cubes. The machine makes a little humming sound but it is not loud.<br /><br />It is easy to install and operate. It fits in well sitting on the kitchen counter and looks awesome with stainless steel finish. It's not heavy and certainly portable. You can carry this in an RV or when you are traveling or camping. But there is no direct line connection to water source.<br /><br />The package was delivered on time and the product was intact. I have rated five stars for overall satisfaction.

   "A Bit Much"
   As many other reviewers have pointed out, this is a rather ginormous appliance that takes up quite a bit of space. For that reason alone, it probably isn't the best choice for most people. It weighs a ton when it is filled with water and isn't easy to cart around when it's empty, either.<br /><br />I would say that this unit would probably be appropriate in very large, open areas like a garage or perhaps a very large living room. It is really overkill for someplace like a bedroom though. Assuming that you have such a large area, the product works fairly well. The large amount of water it holds means that you will not need to refill it for several hours at a time, which can be a problem with the smaller devices.<br /><br />Due to potential mold build-up you will need to rinse this unit out occasionally, which is a bit of a chore. Just picking it up and lugging it around is quite a chore. There are no handles or other easy way to grasp the device. I would recommend only using distilled water in this device in order to minimize how often you will need to clean it.<br /><br />I certainly can't complain that the product does not work as intended. It is just a bit more than most people need and not worth the extra upkeep to me.

Yes, it’s small but we the design is great as we can tuck it in a small corner and because of the great design, front opening and options of which way the door swings open, you can even use it as a side table with a lamp on it.  It also fits flush against the wall, making it ideal for small spaces.<br /><br />The unit is energy efficient, has adjustable temps, and there is even a lock in case you have little ones.

   This machine is a life saver! Works great fits on my tiny counter and is very quiet! Well, except for when it drains into the sink but that doesn't really bother anyone, just sounds like somebody is dumping water. I recommend this to anyone on the fence about it! It saves me so much time.

   "Really good choice for a low-cost disposal"
   This is a bare-bones disposal that is working very well.  Installation was straightforward although there was one step that was confusing and has been discussed in other reviews.  There is not insulation around the body of this disposal as there is on many other models but the noise, though noticeable, is not particularly obnoxious nor pound.  We do not use the disposal heavily but for occasional, light-to-medium duty I believe this is an excellent choice.

   "An excellent purchase."
   Although i am  not a trained plumber i had no problems installing the unit even though I have custom cabinets with granite counters.  The unit is extremely quiet, and the two drawer model works perfectly.  One plus is that I do not have to bend down to load and unload.  A great advantage for someone with arthritis.

Handles a reasonable amount of buildup.<br />Great unit for a one or two person household.<br />Only one VERY SLIGHT con, don't expect fully dried dishes as soon as it's done. You might need to wipe a bit off, but coming from someone who has done dishes by hand for 40 years this is not an inconvenience!

   "Great little ice maker"
   This machine is very handy when we entertain friends and family. It makes ice cubes quickly in two sizes, small and large in under 20 minutes. The large ice cube size is actually average size cubes. The machine makes a little humming sound but it is not loud.<br /><br />It is easy to install and operate. It fits in well sitting on the kitchen counter and looks awesome with stainless steel finish. It's not heavy and certainly portable. You can carry this in an RV or when you are traveling or camping. But there is no direct line connection to water source.<br /><br />The package was delivered on time and the product was intact. I have rated five stars for overall satisfaction.

   "My Son Loves It."
   We purchased one of these for our RV and use it constantly. Our son wanted one for his RV and we surprised him with this one.  He uses it every day and has thanked us for it.  It dumps a load of  ice about every 7 minutes.  After several loads we dump the ice in a ziplock and store in the fridge's freezer.  This portable ice maker will not keep ice frozen.  It would have to be a much larger unit and would not be portable if it could do that.  This ice maker has been one of the best purchases for our RVs, and has become invaluable during hot, humid southwest summers.  We and our son are extremely happy with this purchase.

   "Works well and as advertised."
   [[VIDEOID:df1aa2e9b375653c5a5e63633d4e459c]] I purchased this machine as I always run out of ice at my dinner parties or BBQ's. I love this 13" tall ( 14" deep ) portable Ice Maker Machine as it is easy to move wherever I need it to be. Also fits nicely on my kitchen counter or home bar if you have one.<br />Just fill in the reservoir with regular water (or spring water) set the desired ice size, and you will have ice cubs coming within 8 minutes!<br />This machine knocks out ice cubes faster than my GE refrigerator. The holding bin holds about 1.5 - 2lbs at a time, but makes up to 26lbs in 24 hours. Overall, great for anyone needing ice at anytime. Most important, the ice doesn't have flavored aftertaste. Great for any home, office, trailer, or outdoor party. Uses 110v standard 3 prong built in power cord. If you found my review or pictures interesting or helpful,<br />please rate it as "helpful." I always enjoy writing reviews of products and try to give honest opinions. I base most of my purchases on reviews from others.<br />I know that honest and helpful reviews can make all the difference in a purchasing decision.

   "Excellent buy"
   I purchased the dishwasher 1 month ago to replace a Kenmore dishwasher.<br />Pros: The dishwasher is very well constructed. The fill, rinse and wash cycles are very quiet. The dishes come out clean with no water spots. Thee dishwasher uses a combination of a very hot rinse cycle and Rinse Aid which results in dry spot free dishes.<br />Cons: None

#2 [★★★★★] 
   "My favorite appliance.  Terrific cleaning, gentle to dishes, energy efficient, quiet operation."
   I am loving this choice.  Installed over a year ago.  Gets near-daily use.<br /><br />The only thing even remotely wrong so far: a modest amount of residual soap buildup, easily solved by occasional use of readily available dishwasher cleaning products, run through as a separate cycle.  Normal for any dishwasher, I guess.<br /><br />This is an energy efficient model without a drying heater.  It does a great job of drying using residual heat after the wash/rinse cycle is done.  Once in a while a few select pieces go into the sinkside rack after the load, to finish drying, but that's nominal.  Most of the time everything is fully dry to the touch and goes directly to cupboard.<br /><br />Tip:  Read the manual and you'll really benefit from this model's features.  Learn:<br />* Which settings to use for different cleaning tasks.<br />* How to silence the beep after the load is done.<br />* Which setting selects advanced dish drying.<br />* When, how to use the Sanitize setting (short answer:  it also promotes better dish drying, so use it regularly).<br />* How to optimally load the system before washing.<br />* How to periodically check the rotary arms and the filters as recommended in the manual.  (So far, only the filters have required occasional rinse out, in my own experience.)<br /><br />This model was an upgrade from what my local appliance retailer normally stocks, but I chose it for its multi-level filtration and other upgrade features:  figuring that, for a few bucks more, you install it, then you live with your choice almost every day of your life for several years, so it makes sense to buy a good performer.  This model is.

   "This is a great dishwasher. Saves energy and gets the dishes very clean."
   This dishwasher is doing an excellent job for us.  I too was used to a dishwasher with a &#34;drying element&#34;, however I had turned it off due to the extreme energy usage.  Condensation drying is working well, except for the plastics mentioned by others, which would have melted in the old dishwasher with the dry cycle.  The sanitize cycle helps and only containers I reuse that food came in (like peanut butter jars) can't 'seem to take the heat.  This dishwasher gets my dishes amazingly clean with no pre-washing, and is so quiet I keep checking to see if it's on.  Times have changed since by dishwasher of 1998 and I'm glad!  I would recommend this unit and would buy it again.

   This is a wonderful appliance and suits my needs perfectly. My kitchen doesn't have room for a built-in or a large portable dishwasher.

   "Excellent quality washer with a few minor drawbacks"
   Purchased locally from BBuy, used for 6 months prior to giving a review.<br /><br />Pros:<br />1. Very water efficient. I was switching from the 5-yr old top-loader Whirlpool. This Samsung weights each load to determine the optimal amount of water.<br />2. Washes great even with cold water! (save on energy)<br />3. Easy to use, very intuitive.<br /><br />Drawbacks:<br />1. I placed the washer in the pan (to avoid flooding the floor in case of machine breakdown - paid $20 some dollars at HomeDepot). The pan limits how wide the drain compartment door opens and as a result makes draining and filter cleaning somewhat inconvenient. (Cleaning is required every couple of months. I cleaned once, but there was so little debris/dirt in the filter. Given this and the inconvenience of cleaning, I will clean it again in 6 months. Clean the pockets to minimize the dirt in the filter.<br /><br />2. Some water is being accumulated in the rubber sealant ring around the cover door - I am talking good couple of ounces. As I can imagine, if it's left unwiped, the moisture can grow into mildew. No big deal to wipe it off after each use, but I thought it was worth warning.<br /><br />3. I searched left and right for the stacking kit for this washer and compatible dryer, but the only place that is selling them is samsung autorized part distributor - samsungparts.com. I went to Sears but they refused to sell me the kit cause they didn't sell me the washer/dryer. BestBuy did not have any in stock anywhere in the MidAtlantic region. Had to call samsung directly and was directed to the above mentioned website.<br />*************** I uploaded a bunch of pictures with notes - make sure you check them out **************

#2 [★☆☆☆☆] 
   "Hate It"
   I’m having a difficult time putting into words how much I despise this washer. HATE IT. REALLY HATE IT.<br />If I can spare one person the pain this washer has caused me...at least my experience will be worth something.<br />I chose this washer because I wanted something reliable in a top load model without a bunch of bells and whistles that could break or cause problems. I wanted a good, solid washer that I could depend on. This isn’t it.<br /><br />This washer has a mind of its own. It will fill with water, refuse to begin agitating, and then randomly empty itself dry. This isn’t due to user error. The machine is poorly designed. I’ve had the machine  empty randomly immediately after filling it on multiple occasions under entirely different scenarios. It’s infuriating and wastes tons of time and water. Infuriating. Especially when you’re in a rush or have multiple loads to wash.<br /><br />If this temperamental washer does make it through the cycle, expect to find your clothes wrapped and twisted around the agitator in some sort of hellish Gordian knot. Maybe not with every cycle, but often enough to be maddening. Horrible design.<br /><br />Looking forward to the day I can be rid of this thing. I’ll never buy another GE washer.

   "Not that Great"
   This kit MIGHT be useful if it were better designed. Unfortunately, this has a few strikes against it.<br /><br />Reusable Cups – These are like MANY reusable cups I’ve seen. They can be used with the filter or without. They do filter out the grounds, but only allow for ONE cup at a time use – meaning, if you’re brewing more than one – you have to clean it out.<br /><br />Filters – these do not have a “paper lid” (see the ones for the Perfect Pod system). This causes the grounds to STICK to the top of the cup, much like the grounds sticking to the sides of the provided cup.<br /><br />When using the filters with the cups – you get less coffee per “cup”. Without the filter? You have a HUGE mess to clean up.<br /><br />The only thing good was the scoop. I loved the adorable heart at the end.<br /><br />Honestly, I’d prefer using the Perfect Pod system as it definitely works, even with the Keurig machine I got back in 2011 (yes, over 10+ years ago).<br /><br />The cups are expensive, but I’ve been using mine since about that long. The filters? You can find cheaper ones.<br /><br />While this is a cheaper set by virtue of price, it is “pass it by” kind of thing.

   Great product. It is advertised as 2, so when you order, you already know you are getting 2. But then they send you an email saying that they are sending an extra one...no, you are not. We already knew we were getting 2, otherwise we would not have spent 18 bucks. I would recommend this, as it really allows flavors into the cup that paper filters screen out. It also delivers a clear, clean cup without sediment. I don't like the pushiness to sugmit a review. Received 2 emails about it. Not necessary - great products make the rounds.

   If you are buying based off the infomercials, you might be disappointed.  This does not have the same air flow and you will need to flip your food half way through the process.  That being said.  It works well and browns the meat.<br /><br />One annoying thing is that the plexiglass middle seems to separate from the top piece that has the handle too easily.

The seller did not ask me to change anything but I figured I would since i was refunded.<br />So now you guys know that if it does fail the seller will make it right!

   Fantastic! I wish I'd known about it sooner!<br /><br />UPDATE:<br />I ordered the green unit and it developed a problem so the company replaced it with an orange one. It arrived yesterday and there was an instruction sheet for those 2 bobbles on the rear of the unit. I didn't get that paper with the first one.<br /><br />After you place the unit in your bucket, tuck in those 2 bobbles. No shaking during the cycle. None! You won't have to sit there and hold the unit steady.<br /><br />This company stands behind their product. You can order with confidence. Remember to tuck in your bobbles!

At the time of purchase, it was $589.00. It has since come down, but I really would pay even more for this amazing product. I've had it over a month now and my sister and mom want one, also. I don't post many reviews at all, but I just had to about this product. It isn't a bogus review.  If you are on fence or worried it is not worth the money, I PROMISE you will love it.

   "Don't Waste Your Money!"
   We really like nugget ice, so much that we would buy bags of it from Sonic, so we were excited to find the Opal Counter Top Nugget Ice Maker. It was awesome - made great, soft, nugget ice just like it was supposed to - until it didn't. Exactly one year and two weeks after purchase (right after the one-year warranty), it stopped making ice. We tried all of the trouble-shooting - reset it, unplug it and wait a few hours, clean with vinegar, check the water lines. Nothing helped. It will make about a tablespoon of ice and then quit. Disappointing that a $580 appliance is only good for one year (and two weeks). If you want to pay an average of $50/month for the good ice for about a year, go for it. Just don't be surprised when it breaks.<br /><br />Don't be fooled by all of the 5-star reviews. I would have given it a 5-star review as well for the first 12 months. Check out all of the 1-star reviews - plenty of other folks have had the same experience.

   The best gift I gave this year, the recipient loved it!! Some pro's and con's to note for anyone who is deciding on this product...<br /><br />Pro: 2 sizes of cubes, they are the donut shaped cubes so they are really great for mixed drinks and everyday use.<br />Con: It doesn't make the ice as quickly as depicted. The water reservoir is small so to make a lot of ice it is an all day experience.<br />Pro: It is a quiet machine, only thing you really hear is the ice being dropped.<br />Con: Once the ice is dropped, you want to get it into the freezer. Your new ice will begin to melt together and become one big cube if you leave it go too long.<br /><br />It definitely deserves 4 stars, we love the machine!! If you need a ton of ice, begin early or use backup methods. ENJOY!!

   "Great coffee brewer."
   Where do I start. The aeropress is an amazing piece of equipment. Anyone who is looking for a really great cup of coffee, that tastes amazing and has a low impact on the environment then this is for you. You have the single serve convenience of a keurig, yet not all the wastefulness of the k-cups and all the packaging. Especially if you get yourself the &#34;Able Brewing Disk&#34; (do yourself a favor and buy them both at once). The idea of purchasing a manual coffee maker such as this may seem a little daunting, but after about a week of using it you won't even notice the slight bit of extra work you have to put into making your morning coffee. And trust me, the enhancement in flavor over anything you have brewed with in the past will blow you away, and make up for the little extra work you have to do. Not only is this a genius solution for making yourself a single cup of coffee with out wasting an entire pot, but it's a great solution for making a delicious iced coffee. Just brew it directly into a cup of ice, the heat from the brewing coffee will melt the ice and you will have a perfectly balanced cup of iced coffee. So if you want a great cup of coffee without leaving your house, this is the simplest solution.

   "Truly an outstanding coffee maker!"
   I have used many a coffee maker, Chemex's, Moka Pot's, French Presses, and Siphon styles. This may not be quite my favorite as the Siphon, but it is excellent. I thought when I got it "This has got to be overhyped, it's just a thick plastic-y thing!" but it really is as good as people say. Looks are deceiving. It is wonderful to use, and dead simple. Put your filter in, put the grounds in, put the water in, stir it a bit, put the plunger on, and plunge. It makes excellent coffee, very full bodied, but still with good clarity due to the paper filter. Absolutely no sediment at the bottom of the cup either! Clean up is a breeze, just take the filter holder off, and pop the filter and most of the grounds out with the plunger, rinse, and it's clean. It's so simple and easy, absolutely zero fuss! I recommend this maker for anyone wanting for a quick and easy to clean maker, or for getting into manual coffee making. It requires very little skill, but it has alot you can do, so you'll never truly master it. I bought one, and recommended it highly enough that a friend of mine did too.

It works well and browns the meat.<br /><br />One annoying thing is that the plexiglass middle seems to separate from the top piece that has the handle too easily.

   We purchased the Samsung RSG257AARS a week ago to replace our old Whirlpool (around 25 years old) that chugged along like a locomotive and sounded like one too.<br /><br />It's still early, but thus far I have to give the Samsung a big thumbs up.<br /><br />Pluses:<br />1) Very attractive design inside and out.<br />2) The interior theatre lighting is a nice touch.<br />3) Very effective cooling.<br />4) Exceptionally quiet.<br />5) Simple-to-use controls<br /><br />Minuses:<br />1) The shelving has limited adjustment capability.<br />2) The crisper drawers pull out only half-way, so access is a little compromised.<br />3) The freezer should have a special slot for pizza boxes to be stored upright.<br /><br />Side note: This model has a stainless steel finish and a great cleaner to use is Weiman's Stainless Steel Cleaner and Polish.<br /><br />EDIT:  (7/18/12)  We've now owned this Samsung for nearly three years and are very happy with the purchase.  The 5 stars rating remains accurate insofar as our experience is concerned.  We've had zero problems with this product.  It's super quiet.  Keeps food consistently cold.  And, for us at least, the ice maker works well.<br /><br />EDIT (3/27/13) Still lovin' the fridge.  Zero problems.  Quiet.  Nice.<br /><br />Edit (2/9/14) Going on 5 years now, and absolutely no trouble.  Sorry to read about some of the problems others have experienced.  Maybe we just got lucky.  Maybe Samsung has quality control problems.  Maybe all refrigerators have their supporters and critics.  All I can say is our Samsung has been trouble-free.

   "Don't get it confused with the full size one"
   If you are buying based off the infomercials, you might be disappointed.  This does not have the same air flow and you will need to flip your food half way through the process.  That being said.  It works well and browns the meat.<br /><br />One annoying thing is that the plexiglass middle seems to separate from the top piece that has the handle too easily.  It is supposed to come apart for washing it, but mine tends to come off whenever I take my food out.  Otherwise, it probably would have been 5/5 stars.

   "So far, so good"
   We purchased the Samsung RSG257AARS a week ago to replace our old Whirlpool (around 25 years old) that chugged along like a locomotive and sounded like one too.<br /><br />It's still early, but thus far I have to give the Samsung a big thumbs up.<br /><br />Pluses:<br />1) Very attractive design inside and out.<br />2) The interior theatre lighting is a nice touch.<br />3) Very effective cooling.<br />4) Exceptionally quiet.<br />5) Simple-to-use controls<br /><br />Minuses:<br />1) The shelving has limited adjustment capability.<br />2) The crisper drawers pull out only half-way, so access is a little compromised.<br />3) The freezer should have a special slot for pizza boxes to be stored upright.<br /><br />Side note: This model has a stainless steel finish and a great cleaner to use is Weiman's Stainless Steel Cleaner and Polish.<br /><br />EDIT:  (7/18/12)  We've now owned this Samsung for nearly three years and are very happy with the purchase.  The 5 stars rating remains accurate insofar as our experience is concerned.  We've had zero problems with this product.  It's super quiet.  Keeps food consistently cold.  And, for us at least, the ice maker works well.<br /><br />EDIT (3/27/13) Still lovin' the fridge.  Zero problems.  Quiet.  Nice.<br /><br />Edit (2/9/14) Going on 5 years now, and absolutely no trouble.  Sorry to read about some of the problems others have experienced.  Maybe we just got lucky.  Maybe Samsung has quality control problems.  Maybe all refrigerators have their supporters and critics.  All I can say is our Samsung has been trouble-free.

   "Excellent budget-grade milk-frothing pitcher"
   The pitcher just arrived. It's packaged in a box, wrapped in a plastic bag. This would only be a problem if the carrier mishandles it or, if like mine, Amazon included no stuffing or bubble wrap. (Mine arrived in good condition.)<br /><br />The pitcher is clearly labelled on the inside and fits my thermometer just fine. The intended use is for making lattes and cappuccinos in the mornings. I bought this to replace an 8 oz. X-Chef pitcher which turns out to be too small for my espresso machine, which has a very powerful steam wand.<br /><br />As usual, I washed both pitchers before using, towel-drying the outside, and letting it air dry. No rust, so far, and the stainless looks nice.<br /><br />I will supplement this review after I've used it for a while, and will note any deterioration in the pitcher or if it has other failings.<br /><br />Update: I’ve had this pitcher for several months now. There are no signs whatsoever of rust or any other defects. I use it daily, hand washing and air drying it after each use. It’s perfect for steaming 8 oz of milk, with plenty of room for foam and it makes pouring easy.

   This is an excellent compact dishwasher that is perfect for a small space. It is about the size of a large microwave. I found that it is light enough for one person to maneuver, but it's easier with two people. It has a good capacity for such a compact unit. It's easy to operate and comes with a power cord and connection hoses. It's likely that you'll have to purchase an additional adapter to fit your faucet.<br /><br />The dishwasher looks nice and operates with minimal noise. The item comes securely packaged in Styrofoam to ensure it will arrive in good working order. This is a convenient and practical dishwasher for a small living space.

#2 [★★★★★] 
   "Made in China. Pricey but it comes in handy. Nice for small spaces."
   This is a handy… Albeit kind of expensive… “Gadget”. Great for smaller places like studio apartments… Motorhomes… Dorm rooms… And so on. It connects to your faucet and loads from the top. Granted, handwashing can be much faster, but if you really don’t like washing dishes, then this is a cool item. It is easy to load from the top. You can also use it to wash fruits and vegetables.<br /><br />Keep in mind that this small dishwasher must be connected to a faucet. Some other models you pour water into them with a pitcher, but not this one.<br /><br />This dishwasher is made in China and being sold by Chinese company on Amazon. At the current price of 270 bucks I’m sure it’s at least 100 bucks overpriced, but again it comes in very handy.

   "Great little washer"
   I've had this little gem now for ten months and I'm still as pleased as the day it arrived.  This is a great dishwasher for tiny apartments (like mine), and for those without a lot of dishes (so, probably not a family of six, let's say).  I find it holds the majority of my dishes (a few huge mixing bowls are a challenge, and my plates do have to tilt just a little to go in, but they are larger than normal plates, so I can't grade down on that), and that it has worked fantastically.  It hooks up easily to my sink, and I love that I can use cold water (which does heat in the washer, so your dishes are getting the benefit of very hot water in the wash!).  Would highly recommend this product.

#4 [★★★★★] 
   "Say bye bye to hand washing dishes"
   If you are living in an apartment and don't have a dishwasher you might want to check this out. This is designed to sit on the countertop, draws its water source from the faucet via a included hose, and drains into the sink via provided hose. It plugs into a regular 110v outlet.<br /><br />This unit also has a fruits and veg washing setting which I found pretty interesting!  Remember to clean your filter each use.<br /><br />I wl update as the appliance gets more use

   "Made some adjustments to make it so worth it!"
   We’ve been using this mini dishwasher for a few weeks now and I’m impressed with how well it cleans. Usually we just use the “eco” setting without any issue. We’ve made some small adjustments to make this dishwasher work for us. We no longer use dinner sized plates and sometimes our family of three runs it twice per day. I have to hand wash pans because they won’t fit but even so this dishwasher has been a lifesaver and has even helped with my depression. We’d like to get a splitter so we can leave it hooked up to the faucet but we have yet to find the right size for our sink. This appliance is worth it for us.

   "Great so far"
   I’ve tried many off brand filters trying to save money on my whirlpool refrigerator but always end up going back to the OEM Everydrop because the off brands give the water a weird taste and odor- chemically, plasticity, musty, etc. I’m thrilled to say that these have a crisp and clean taste that is as good or even better than the brand name. I also love that these have all 3 filtration certifications just like the brand name- 401, 53, and 42. They were easy to install. The flow is definitely less than the oem brand but for the price I am willing to deal with that one flaw. If they got these up to the same .8gpm flow rate these would be 5 star. Time will tell if they last as long but considering I got 3 filters for 2/3 the price of ONE brand name filter I think I will still come out ahead regardless.

   "Don't Waste Your Money!"
   We really like nugget ice, so much that we would buy bags of it from Sonic, so we were excited to find the Opal Counter Top Nugget Ice Maker. It was awesome - made great, soft, nugget ice just like it was supposed to - until it didn't. Exactly one year and two weeks after purchase (right after the one-year warranty), it stopped making ice. We tried all of the trouble-shooting - reset it, unplug it and wait a few hours, clean with vinegar, check the water lines. Nothing helped. It will make about a tablespoon of ice and then quit. Disappointing that a $580 appliance is only good for one year (and two weeks). If you want to pay an average of $50/month for the good ice for about a year, go for it. Just don't be surprised when it breaks.<br /><br />Don't be fooled by all of the 5-star reviews. I would have given it a 5-star review as well for the first 12 months. Check out all of the 1-star reviews - plenty of other folks have had the same experience.

   "The “good” ice."
   I’ve been wanting a nugget ice maker for a while. I’m mostly happy with this one. It’s simple to operate, even though the manual makes it seem more complicated. It makes the ice pretty quickly. It has network capability to connect to your mobile device through a downloadable app. It also has a filter to help purify the water before freezing.<br /><br />A couple things dropped it to four stars. For one, the only way to retrieve the ice is through a front dispenser that takes a bit of time. There is a small flap at the top where you *could* scoop it out, but it wouldn’t be easy. My other issue is that once the ice is made, it isn’t kept cold so it needs to be removed soon. With a $400 price I think it should have a refrigerated compartment.

   "GE Opal for half the $"
   I over-research all large purchases and this was no exception. Wanted a nugget ice maker for our new wet bar and was all set to buy the GE Opal but was concerned about all the lukewarm reviews given its hefty price tag. After reading reviews for every competitive offering on Amazon decided to get the Crownful and so glad I did. Works great - love the easy access tilt up door and removable basket. Also love that you pour additional water right into same compartment instead of messing with removable tank (like our keurig has). If you zoom in on the photos and compare to the Opal they make identical ice. And this thing makes LOTS of it. Started producing in about 20 minutes and even with me scooping it up as fast as it could make it to put in a couple of mixed drinks it filled its basket in no time and has had no trouble keeping up since. The ice storage must be well insulated because even overnight there’s still plenty of unmelted ice the next morning. I think what pushed me to pull the trigger on this one was several reviews from people who’d gone through 2 or 3 Opals in a very short period of time. I’m thinking you could buy 2 of these for what the Opal costs and literally have a spare. Oh and here’s what else my research revealed: this and the Opal are the only 2 nugget ice makers Amazon sells an extended warranty on but it was $90 on the Opal and $12 on this one - that’s a no brainer. But it gets better - if you register it with the manufacturer they upgrade the first year limited warranty to a one year replacement warranty. Buy this! You won’t be disappointed.

   "Nice Ice"
   This ice maker is very easy to use. It makes bullet shaped cubes that are great in blender drinks. It is efficient but a tad noisy. Have had no performance isdues. The self cleaning function is a plus. It is super simple and does a hooid job. The ice does not store in the maker, it mudt GB be removed. Otherwise it melts and the water is recycled to make more ice. The ice tastes good and is chewable if you are into that. The unit is vom pop act and does not take up too much counter space. The ice tastes clean and fresh. There is a handle so this can be transported without fuss. Nice.

   "Best coffee maker (cone) I have ever found"
   This is one of the best things for making coffee.  It fits in ALL of my thermal carafes, there may be some it doesn't but it has worked in all of mine.  It is more narrow than other drip coffee filters which makes a little stronger brew.  I have no idea why it works that way but it does. I use the size 6 coffee filters.  Yes you have to heat the water separately but, for me, it is worth it.  There is a rather zen thing about it all.<br /><br />Plus, you get to buy the carafe(s) you want so you can get a cool carafe.  I really can't recommend this simple thing high enough.  If you are a coffee nerd as opposed to a hipster -- just relax for 5 minutes and make better coffee.  Well that really is enough about that!

   "Great washer, saving me from visiting the local laundromat"
   I have a small cabin in the mountains that did not have connections for a large washer/dryer...so I bought this smaller machine and dryer to save me from having to go out to the laundromat.  Especially when we get a couple of feet of snow...doing laundry at home is so much better.  It fits everything nicely, even large 'thick' towels.  I have also done CalKing sheets in it too, full set w/ pillowcases at the same time.<br /><br />I notice the machine can get out of balance with heaver/larger items, so sometimes I need to split those up, but in general it works out very well.  No leaking (I have had it about 4 months so far), if it gets out of balance the machine automatically adjusts itself and sometimes I don't need to do anything at all.  I find it re-balances the load better than I can - it is pretty smart - which surprised me the first time it did that!<br /><br />It's a keeper and a lifesaver!  My one gripe is I should have bought the slightly larger version of this machine - I might have been able to get my quilts done in it.  Right now, I will have to still go to the laundromat a few times a year to get larger stuff like that washed.

   "Great for Daily Use"
   Because the laundromat is a 15 minute drive from my place, this tiny washing machine is a godsend. It can only handle up to a day's worth of laundry, but that's good enough for me. Larger clothing items like blankets and jackets are too big for it. A tip is to keep the spinning clothes centered to avoid loud noises.

   "Awesome little "machine""
   I ordered this directly from the Laundry Alternative and I'm very happy with the purchase.  My biggest reason for purchasing it is the high electric rates we pay here in NH.  I've tried washing a variety of items in the WonderWash and have come to a &#34;compromise&#34; method.  Since they are heavy when wet and are bulky anyways, I still wash jeans and towels in the regular washing machine but everything else gets washed in the WonderWash.  I'll do a few loads (enough to equal what can go in the big washer), and then instead of wringing everything by hand, I'll squeeze out some water and put the items into a trash bag lined clothes basket and then pop all the items into the regular washer just for a drain and spin cycle.  Since my big washer is a front loader, this gets out most of the extra water while only using the machine for about 10 minutes.  For me, this method works great.<br /><br />Update:  Since reviewing this machine, I have purchased the Mini Countertop Spin Dryer from the Laundry Alternative.  I also have written a review on that dryer giving it a high rating also.  I do now wash jeans in the WonderWash, but towels still get put in the large washing machine.  This combination is saving me $40 per month over using my big washing machine and occasional use of my large full-sized dryer.  I also plan to take this on vacation this summer since I think I'd be lost without it now.  :-)<br /><br />This product was a personal purchase for myself at the normal retail price. I am reviewing it solely because I want to share my experience with other potential customers. I have received no compensation for my review nor do I have any relationship with the seller or manufacturer of this product.

   "Small Spaces, Small Loads"
   This compact washer is simple to set up. It works surprisingly well with a few caveats. First keep the loads small. This will handle underwear, socks, light tops, baby clothes not bedding, or heavily soiled items. It cleans and rinses efficiently. Clothes come out nice and clean. It is easy to use. There is a pump to help drain. It is portable and can be tucked away when not in use.

   "Fantastic for small loads"
   [[VIDEOID:ccc097e5bd804d0eeecff2aeec3567a3]] This folding, portable washing machine is fantastic!! It is easy to set up, fill, wash and spin. It's suction cups on the bottom keep it from moving. My first load was a bunch of nasty masks from my husband that he uses at work. A small amount of Gain and about 20 minutes and they were super clean and in my little RV dryer. Great for underwear, kitchen towels, etc. I have a large RV washer but hate to set it up for little things. Problem solved. Worth every penny, to me. Fabulous product found on Amazon!!

   Love the product. Easy to install. I installed at 31 inches above range to get good head clearance. I'm 6ft tall. I have concrete walls so I had to burst a 6 inch hole in the wall with a hilti hammer drill. You have to purchase a vent for the outside wall separately.

   "Truly an outstanding coffee maker!"
   I have used many a coffee maker, Chemex's, Moka Pot's, French Presses, and Siphon styles. This may not be quite my favorite as the Siphon, but it is excellent. I thought when I got it "This has got to be overhyped, it's just a thick plastic-y thing!" but it really is as good as people say. Looks are deceiving. It is wonderful to use, and dead simple. Put your filter in, put the grounds in, put the water in, stir it a bit, put the plunger on, and plunge. It makes excellent coffee, very full bodied, but still with good clarity due to the paper filter. Absolutely no sediment at the bottom of the cup either! Clean up is a breeze, just take the filter holder off, and pop the filter and most of the grounds out with the plunger, rinse, and it's clean. It's so simple and easy, absolutely zero fuss! I recommend this maker for anyone wanting for a quick and easy to clean maker, or for getting into manual coffee making. It requires very little skill, but it has alot you can do, so you'll never truly master it. I bought one, and recommended it highly enough that a friend of mine did too.
