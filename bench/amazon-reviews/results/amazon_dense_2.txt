QUERY: quiet dishwasher that actually cleans dishes well
======================================================================
[Latency: 223.3ms]

#1 [★★★★★]  (sim: 0.648)
   "My favorite appliance.  Terrific cleaning, gentle to dishes, energy efficient, quiet operation."
   I am loving this choice.  Installed over a year ago.  Gets near-daily use.<br /><br />The only thing even remotely wrong so far: a modest amount of residual soap buildup, easily solved by occasional use of readily available dishwasher cleaning products, run through as a separate cycle.  Normal for any dishwasher, I guess.<br /><br />This is an energy efficient model without a drying heater.  It does a great job of drying using residual heat after the wash/rinse cycle is done.  Once in a while a few select pieces go into the sinkside rack after the load, to finish drying, but that's nominal.  Most of the time everything is fully dry to the touch and goes directly to cupboard.<br /><br />Tip:  Read the manual and you'll really benefit from this model's features.  Learn:<br />* Which settings to use for different cleaning tasks.<br />* How to silence the beep after the load is done.<br />* Which setting selects advanced dish drying.<br />* When, how to use the Sanitize setting (short answer:  it also promotes better dish drying, so use it regularly).<br />* How to optimally load the system before washing.<br />* How to periodically check the rotary arms and the filters as recommended in the manual.  (So far, only the filters have required occasional rinse out, in my own experience.)<br /><br />This model was an upgrade from what my local appliance retailer normally stocks, but I chose it for its multi-level filtration and other upgrade features:  figuring that, for a few bucks more, you install it, then you live with your choice almost every day of your life for several years, so it makes sense to buy a good performer.  This model is.

   "Very happy with this dishwasher"
   This is a wonderful appliance and suits my needs perfectly. My kitchen doesn't have room for a built-in or a large portable dishwasher. I am thrilled with how well this unit cleans my dishes, even on the lighter cycles. I also appreciate having so many wash options, from a rinse to a full heavy wash.

   "Great dishwasher for the size"
   This product works very well (do not expect it to eat away dried or crusted on food, but most full-sized dishwashers I have had won't either). It has enough room for all I need but pots and pans, and it cleans well and works with ease. The price point is a bit high in my opinion, but the product does work as advertised and it is much better than my apartment's 15 year old POS dishwasher.

   "Live alone in a place with a broken full-size dishwasher"
   Apartments...you see a dishwasher built in and think, woo-hoo, no more washing dishes by hand, right?  I don't have a clue what is wrong with that dishwasher other than it deposits rather greasy white streaks on dishes.  I tried CLR, vinegar, and a few other treatments plus talking to the apartment manager and nothing works or has been done to fix it.  I got this small countertop dishwasher and while it may not be as perfect as having a full-size one that works, it DOES work without leaving white greasy streaks on my dishes.  At least I'm not washing dishes by hand every day - this dishwasher works well for me.  It doesn't hold a great many dishes, but as one person, I don't make a ton of dishes.  I'd say this would be great for an older couple or might be good for an RV.  I am happy not to be doing dishes by hand!

   "I'm a fan"
   We actually bought this for the trailer we've had to move into after a fire in our home. At first it was kind of a lark but the machine turns out to be pretty awesome. Some of the cycles can take up to an hour and a half but it is really quiet (to the  point, where at first, I kept opening it to see if it was actually working - it was). It cleans dishes, glasses and flatware beautifully and sterilizes them. The downside is, well, it's a countertop dishwasher so it doesn't fit large dishes or pots. But circumstances being what they are, while we are rebuilding, this dishwasher is a lifesaver and I am tickled with my purchase!

   This counter top ice maker is amazing! I love that it doesn't require a water line to use! I also love that it is actually very quiet!! It makes the perfect size ice cubes, very quickly!! Another feature that I love is that is reuses the melted ice cubes to make new ones, therefore less waste! If you order this ice maker, you won't regret it!!

   "Wonderful"
   This portable dishwasher is amazing. Perfect for small spaces it is simple to set up and use. It does a terrific job. There are a number of settings: normal, rapid, fruit, steam and glass. ,The fruit option insures your produce is free of dirt. No detergent needed for this cycle.  It uses powdered dishwasher detergent or those dishwasher tabs. The capacity is small but it saves you from running the full sized washer. It is portable and ideal for rvs or camping. My kitchen isa disaster due to a pandemic interrupted andcpostponed rennovation. This countertop appliance makes life easier.

   "Who wants to do dishes by hand?"
   I have a small trailer for camping and I am so happy to have this small dishwasher that I can stow in the trailer!  It's a bit larger than is easy to stow, but I did find room for it and I'm quite happy that I did!  This small dishwasher holds more than you would think and the wash/rinse cycle does one heck of a job to clean the dishes.  I love that it does not require adding hot water - that the dishwasher can heat the water itself.  As for how it cleans - it does a very decent job though I suspect part of the reason is that for such a small space, the water jets can get to every part of the dirty dishes loaded on it!  The only thing I could wish for is that it weigh less - 30 pounds on something kind of large and bulky means I do wrestle with it when stowing it away and getting it back out to use it the next time.  Still, it does a great job of washing dishes!

#3 [★★★☆☆]  (sim: 0.701)
   "Not so compact, but works."
   I've used portable dishwashers before and they are AWESOME for people who travel or have dietary restrictions (Kosher, for example, need separate washers for milk and meat dishes). The good news is, this actually seems like it does a decent job and even comes with some complimentary detergent and jet dry in the box, so you can get up and running right away... in some cases, at least. I say that because depending on how you hook it up, you may need additional hardware to connect to your water lines and/or sink.<br />Here's my problem with it- they claim it is a "countertop" style washer, but the thing is actually too big for my counter! I don't have enough clearance under the cabinets to fit, and it has a lot of hoses and tubing to connect as well. I was considering drilling into my counter to feed the tubes to the water supply and drain, but decided to try connecting to the sink instead when we saw it wasn't fitting well under the cabinets. But then it is too close to the sink and with the hoses etc connected, it looks like it is taking over the kitchen more than just an appliance on the counter like a toaster.<br />I've seen smaller counter-top dishwashers that would easily fit better in our space. Perhaps this one does a better job, but at this point I feel like it is too big to fit the way I intended to use it, but too small to be one we install permanently in the cabinet space. Perhaps someone else will find this size useful, I'm a little disappointed because I was so excited for this to work.

   "Compact and Convenient Dishwasher"
   This is an excellent compact dishwasher that is perfect for a small space. It is about the size of a large microwave. I found that it is light enough for one person to maneuver, but it's easier with two people. It has a good capacity for such a compact unit. It's easy to operate and comes with a power cord and connection hoses. It's likely that you'll have to purchase an additional adapter to fit your faucet.<br /><br />The dishwasher looks nice and operates with minimal noise. The item comes securely packaged in Styrofoam to ensure it will arrive in good working order. This is a convenient and practical dishwasher for a small living space.

#5 [★★★★★]  (sim: 0.691)
   "Small Space Help"
   This small dishwasher is ideal for small spaces. Set up was straightforward, not easy but not difficult either. It is reasonably quiet and simple to use. I use pods or tablets. It is a compact unit. If you spend a week waiting to have a full load, this is for you. One of my brothers loves the fruit/veggie washing function.  It handles standard sizes, ie., ten inch dinner plates, regular cups, but nothing extra large. Pleased so far.

   I have really hard water in my area and other refrigerator filters just didn't work at getting rid of the taste that the water has. This filter got rid of the taste and filtered out all of the particulates as well, so now we have perfectly flavorless water.

   "Fits great, offers good filtering and great price"
   Because I already have a very fine reverse osmosis filter on the water system before it gets to my Samsung fridge, I just needed to add a medium level filter for sediment and taste and to turn the darn "change filter" alarm off.  I have had good results with this Aquacrest model.  Changing out the filter is a snap and it fits perfectly with no leaks.  After replacing the filter and turning back on the flow, I purged out the line by running about a gallon out.  After that the water ran clear and tasted great.

   This is really a quiet range  hood. I looked for a low sone ranking....the motor is indeed quiet, and I like the variable speeds. On Quiet setting, it is really a nice, quiet hum. My only wish for improvement would be with the lighting. The lights are at the front of unit. My back burners on not lighted as much as I would like, so I usually turn on my undercounted lighting.

   Everything we expected. Good suction, sleek and not unattractive over the island. Our range is 36" and so is the hood. The glass is nice, I have yet to tackle cleaning. The baffles are rated best in regards to filters and in my restaurant experience it seems these will be easier to clean. It is pretty quiet on medium setting. We have not decided our new lighting, and we are messy today but here's a pic.

   "Great slimline range hood"
   I recently converted from an electric range to gas and needed a slimline range hood that could move a lot of air. This product fits the bill nicely. It looks good, works great, was relatively easy to install with a 7&#34; exhaust pipe (they recommend a minimum of 6&#34; for this airflow) and matches the new brushed stainless range very nicely. The lights work surprisingly well too. They use 430 stainless which is magnetic, so I'm assuming that it could rust if left in the wrong condition, yet I have encountered no problems to date. The only downside is that it's a bit louder than I'd like, but for 600 CFM I really can't complain. And, I mostly use the quiet setting which still allows for normal voice conversations whereas on the high setting you pretty much can't hear yourself think. Overall I'm quite satisfied with the purchase.

   Such an improvement! We replaced an old 42" vented hood.  It took less than an hour!<br />This model is convertible for either vented or not and has access panels for the vent on the top and the back.  We ordered one and it arrived all dented. It was replaced and we're very happy with this one. It has great suction, is quiet and the black finish is easy to clean.

   "Innovative, quality, flavorful, fast cleanup, very portable"
   Cleanup after brewing is 10 seconds. The material is very high quality and does not stain or break down from the coffee oils. This brew method definitely favors fruity coffees like Ethiopian, but all taste good. Similar to -but not exactly like- French press, but you won’t have any silt at the bottom of your cup.

I love that it makes a delicious cup of coffee in about 3-4 minutes. It is more convenient than my French press. Works perfectly for one cup at a time. For this price, you can't beat the value and usefulness. I will be purchasing more for gifts. Nice red color, too.

   "brews strong"
   Bought to replace a non working 'upgraded' Keurig that would not work with my SFBay cups from Costco, my favorite coffee.  Lots to like about this machine: the finish, the features, the cool little compartment where the little cup is held, etc..  But the best thing is how strong coffee is brewed.  Crazy but coffee comes out much stronger than in the Keurig, so I only need one mug instead of two every morning.<br /><br />The only downside is that you have to turn it on manually, instead of it turning on automatically when you raise the cup lever.  Other than that 5 stars.

   "Really good choice for a low-cost disposal"
   This is a bare-bones disposal that is working very well.  Installation was straightforward although there was one step that was confusing and has been discussed in other reviews.  There is not insulation around the body of this disposal as there is on many other models but the noise, though noticeable, is not particularly obnoxious nor pound.

   "No frills modern necessity."
   Replaced an old fridge about 20 years old.  The size of the new fridge meets my needs since I am single, and don't need to stock it full for a family.<br /><br />I selected the fridge based on size and energy star rating.  The fridge uses a little over 1 kilowatt per 24 hours.  This is important to me as I live off-grid with solar power, a backup generator, and batteries for night time power.  I find that this new fridge cycles less and is quieter than the old fridge.  In the short time I have had the new fridge in service, it appears to save over 3% of electricity use in a 24 hour period.  This is a huge given that batteries supply the power to it for at least 12 hours a day.<br /><br />I opted out of the icemaker, which increases the freezer capacity by about 25%.

   I have had two of these coolers in my office and a third at home for a little over two years. They all work flawlessly.<br /><br />The compressors are a little noisy compared to a standard refrigerator. But I'm just used to it. It wont make you deaf or keep you from sleeping.<br /><br />Mine all keep constant temperatures. I keep each fridge at 34 degrees. On one occasion a can froze and exploded.<br /><br />Defrost is simple; just turn the temperature up a little and the heat from the compressor evaporates any ice when it melts. I dont like frostless drink fridges because they dont keep a constant temperature. So that's a trade off. My office and home are fully modern but our country place is a little different, and I know from staying there that frostless refrigeration does NOT keep a constant temperature and requires more electricity (more cycles of the compressor).
