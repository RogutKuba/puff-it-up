QUERY: countertop dishwasher with fruit and vegetable wash cycle
======================================================================
[Latency: 882.5ms, Candidates: 435]

#1 [★★★★★] 
   "Wonderful"
   This portable dishwasher is amazing. Perfect for small spaces it is simple to set up and use. It does a terrific job. There are a number of settings: normal, rapid, fruit, steam and glass. ,The fruit option insures your produce is free of dirt. No detergent needed for this cycle.  It uses powdered dishwasher detergent or those dishwasher tabs. The capacity is small but it saves you from running the full sized washer. It is portable and ideal for rvs or camping. My kitchen isa disaster due to a pandemic interrupted andcpostponed rennovation. This countertop appliance makes life easier.

   "Say bye bye to hand washing dishes"
   If you are living in an apartment and don't have a dishwasher you might want to check this out. This is designed to sit on the countertop, draws its water source from the faucet via a included hose, and drains into the sink via provided hose. It plugs into a regular 110v outlet.<br /><br />This unit also has a fruits and veg washing setting which I found pretty interesting!  Remember to clean your filter each use.<br /><br />I wl update as the appliance gets more use

#3 [★★★★★] 
   "Made in China. Pricey but it comes in handy. Nice for small spaces."
   This is a handy… Albeit kind of expensive… “Gadget”. Great for smaller places like studio apartments… Motorhomes… Dorm rooms… And so on. It connects to your faucet and loads from the top. Granted, handwashing can be much faster, but if you really don’t like washing dishes, then this is a cool item. It is easy to load from the top. You can also use it to wash fruits and vegetables.<br /><br />Keep in mind that this small dishwasher must be connected to a faucet. Some other models you pour water into them with a pitcher, but not this one.<br /><br />This dishwasher is made in China and being sold by Chinese company on Amazon. At the current price of 270 bucks I’m sure it’s at least 100 bucks overpriced, but again it comes in very handy.

   "Excellent buy"
   I purchased the dishwasher 1 month ago to replace a Kenmore dishwasher.<br />Pros: The dishwasher is very well constructed. The fill, rinse and wash cycles are very quiet. The dishes come out clean with no water spots. Thee dishwasher uses a combination of a very hot rinse cycle and Rinse Aid which results in dry spot free dishes.<br />Cons: None

   "Good taste, perfect fit."
   It did take two tries to get a perfect fit, but there was no significant mess made. Once it was in, it was solid, and has remained that way for this first month of use. The filter gives a nice fresh tasting water, removing all the chlorine and other &#34;flavors&#34; I get from the tap.

[Latency: 674.0ms, Candidates: 523]

#1 [★★★★★] 
   "Made in China. Make sure you know how this machine works before purchasing."
   If you have a look around Amazon, you will see that there are lots… And lots… And lots of these icemakers listed by Chinese companies on Amazon right now. Some of them look a little different from each other, but they all basically work the same. As long as you have the right expectations, they work very well. But if your expectations are too high, you will be very disappointed.<br /><br />Some of the basic things you need to know about this icemaker… First of all, it is not connected to a water source. You pour water into the reservoir. Next, the ice is not kept frozen inside. The machine will make ice until the bin is full. Then the ice will melt, if not removed from the bin, and will be recycled again and again and again. Freezing… Melting… Freezing… Melting… And so on. For this reason, you really need to turn it off at night when you’re sleeping or when you leave the office, if you are using it in an office environment.<br /><br />When the bin is full, which takes about an hour, you will have enough ice to fill a 32 ounce water bottle. Though the listing shows that it will make 26 pounds of ice within twenty-four hours, that is only possible if someone is going to remove the ice each time the bin is full… Day and night. If you want to make ice and save it, then you will need to place it into your own freezer. But keep in mind that the ice will be “wet” so when you place it into your own freezer it will freeze together and you will need to break it apart to use it.<br /><br />This icemaker is made in China and being sold by Chinese company on Amazon.

   "Made in China. Nice with the right expectations. Does not keep the ice frozen."
   This is the white option of this icemaker. It also comes in black, sold by the same company.<br /><br />There are lots and lots of different Chinese companies which are selling icemakers on Amazon which are very similar or the same as this one. There are a couple of differences between this one and many of the others. One is the fact that this one makes ten bullets of ice instead of nine… The other is the fact that this one has a timer so that it will not continue to run at times when you do not need it to, like when you’re sleeping.<br /><br />The listing shows that this particular icemaker can make up to 33 pounds of ice in a twenty-four hour period. This might be true, but that is only if you continually remove the ice from the basket as it is being made. The ice maker makes the ten bullets of ice… Then place them into a basket. If you do not remove the ice from the basket, then it simply melts and refreeze is. Once the ice is in the basket, the machine will not keep the ice frozen. If you need a lot of ice, then you will need to manually remove the ice from the basket and place it into your own freezer.<br /><br />This icemaker is made in China and being sold by Chinese coming on Amazon. It works quite well as long as you have the right expectations.

#3 [★★★★★] 
   "Made in China.  Nice, if you have the proper expectations."
   You really have to make sure you have the right expectations with this ice maker.<br /><br />There are a few important things to keep in mind<br /><br />#1.  This ice maker does NOT keep the ice which is made frozen.  It drops into the bin. .. then melts and is recycled if you do not use it.  If you want to keep it frozen. . . You'll need to place it into your own freezer.<br /><br />#2.  Though the listing shows that this ice maker can make 26# of ice in 24-hours. . .  That's only if you have someone standing there to empty the bin each time it is full. . .  day-and-night.  So that part is really no realistic.<br /><br />#3.  "Self-Cleaning" is a misnomer.  When you turn-on the "self-cleaning" cycle. .. All that happens is that the water is cycled through again and again until you stop it.  So there's really not a lot of cleaning going on unless you add something to the water.  There's no information about what to add.  You can do your own research. .  but. . . I actually use the same cleaner I use with my espresso maker for descaling.<br /><br />This ice maker is Made in China and being sold by a Chinese company on Amazon.  There are lots of these same machines being sold by Chinese companies right now on Amazon, so make sure you look around for the best price before purchasing.

   "Nice ice maker and very easy to use"
   This is a great ice maker for your countertop.  It’s really easy and straight forward to use.<br /><br />Let’s start with the control panel - it’s a few simple buttons.  You turn the machine on and say if you want small or large ice cubes.  That’s it!  Personally I preferred the large cubes.<br /><br />It’s got a light for when your ice bin is full.  It’s clear to see.  There’s also a light to add water if it’s running low.  I filled the water bin up and I think it made 2-3 gallon bags of ice.

#5 [★★★★★] 
   "Anytime Ice"
   Get ready for holiday parties, no more running last minute to get a bag of ice.<br /><br />This ice maker cranks out the cubes, and you can select the size. No need to worry about ice overflowing, it will beep and stop making the ice when it's full, or when the water runs out.<br /><br />The display is easy and 'talks' you through the process.<br />Definitely one of those purchases that you don't realize how much you'll use it until you have one.<br /><br />DISCLOSURE: Product received to test, with the option to review.

   We prefer pour over coffee. This is fast, convenient, easy to clean and sturdy onto of a cup. With it being stainless steel I don't have to worry about it breaking like the ceramic ones.

   "Fit but inhibits proper brewing"
   I haveva 4-cup drip coffee maker and too often the filter collapses and allows groups to get into the carafe.<br /><br />These fit well into the basket of the coffee maker but didn't allow the dripper spring to function properly allowing the water to run through too quickly naking very week, pate coffee.<br /><br />Not a total waste as I will repurpose them for straing bacon grease and beef tallow.

   "Compact and Convenient Dishwasher"
   This is an excellent compact dishwasher that is perfect for a small space. It is about the size of a large microwave. I found that it is light enough for one person to maneuver, but it's easier with two people. It has a good capacity for such a compact unit. It's easy to operate and comes with a power cord and connection hoses. It's likely that you'll have to purchase an additional adapter to fit your faucet.<br /><br />The dishwasher looks nice and operates with minimal noise. The item comes securely packaged in Styrofoam to ensure it will arrive in good working order. This is a convenient and practical dishwasher for a small living space.

   Saw this in the store and took a chance. Main reason I bought it was cause it’s stainless steel and not pastic. Trying to use less plastic when cooking my foods/beverages. Works great! Liked it so much I bought a spare and two for my daughter! Note: because it is metal it WILL be hot after use.

   "Unexpected features are a plus"
   I ordered this because it does not have halogen lights and also the profile is small enough that I shouldn't be hitting my head on it constantly when cooking.  I love it because the fans are quiet and it looks quite stylist--at least for me since my kitchen is in transition.  The stainless steel matches my dishwasher while the black control panel ties in with my stove and refrigerator.
