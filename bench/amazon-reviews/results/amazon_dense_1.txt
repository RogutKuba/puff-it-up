QUERY: quiet dishwasher that actually cleans dishes well
======================================================================
[Latency: 98.0ms]

#1 [★★★★★]  (sim: 0.648)
   "My favorite appliance.  Terrific cleaning, gentle to dishes, energy efficient, quiet operation."
   I am loving this choice.  Installed over a year ago.  Gets near-daily use.<br /><br />The only thing even remotely wrong so far: a modest amount of residual soap buildup, easily solved by occasional use of readily available dishwasher cleaning produc...

   "Very happy with this dishwasher"
   This is a wonderful appliance and suits my needs perfectly. My kitchen doesn't have room for a built-in or a large portable dishwasher. I am thrilled with how well this unit cleans my dishes, even on the lighter cycles. I also appreciate having so ma...

   "Great dishwasher for the size"
   This product works very well (do not expect it to eat away dried or crusted on food, but most full-sized dishwashers I have had won't either). It has enough room for all I need but pots and pans, and it cleans well and works with ease. The price poin...

   "Great suction, but vibration on low speed, and really lights are very dim"
   The unit has strong venting which is good, but there is vibration on lowest and highest speed, even though the fan motor is solidly attached to the unit and are using a 6 inch vent, and the light is very dim where it has no purpose, and just on/off.
