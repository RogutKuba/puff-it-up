QUERY: ice maker that doesn't leak water on counter

   "Portable ice maker for your countertop"
   Great ice maker for the money. If your planning a party or just want some extra ice, this will do the job. It does require that you add water to start the cycle and when it's full, you have to use it or bag it, but I can live with that. The only problem is that it doesn't store ice. If the basket has ice in it, and you turn it off, the ice will melt back to water.

   "Makes good ice"
   This machine makes "bar quality" ice very fast. The ice is mostly clear. It drops 9 cubes about every 10 minutes, give or take a minute. It has a good size reservoir for water. You'll get at least 3 bins of ice for every refill. Cleanup is easy. It outpaces my other under-counter bar ice maker; of a well known name, and the noise level is about half that of the under-counter bar ice maker. Ice melt recycles if you do not empty the bin. Which my under-counter model just wastes. It will automatically stop when the bin is full. One word of caution. This goes for every "bar ice type" maker. Do NOT put the ice into your freezer. It will simply freeze into a big wad of ice. If you need to keep a quantity of ice then just put it into something like a styrofoam chest. All of the ice will remain as separate cubes.

   "It locks up several times a day"
   I use gallons of ice each day.  I need an ice maker.  The previous one lasted for two years.  This looked like the same model.  (Frankly, all the stand-alone ice makers look alike.)  One immediately obvious difference: the previous model used a light-beam to detect a full tray; this one uses a thermometer.  Not a huge deal: it notices a full tray a little later with the thermometer.  Then I heard the click-click-click.  The ice scooper was jammed.  I un-jammed it.  Fine.  Now it jams every hour.  When it jams, it turns on the full and out-of-water lights when it is neither full nor low on water.  I don't have to un-jam it, just reset it.  I have a few days to return it.  But I need an ice maker.  (As an aside, the light beam on my previous ice maker should have been modulated on the send-side and filtered on the receive-side so that direct sunlight wouldn't have let it overfill.  Duct tape over the window solved that problem.)

   "WON'T LIVE WITHOUT THIS"
   I live in Las Vegas and drink ice water all day long. I got sick of fighting with ice cube trays. Ice doesn't come out of plastic trays, and the modern version of the metal trays our parents used are so flimsy that they break more easily than the ice they contain. I also got sick of ice in my freezer all solidifying into one massive lump. This ice maker is the perfect answer. I just leave it running around the clock. No, it doesn't keep ice frozen, but when the ice melts, the water goes back in the reservoir and is reprocessed. Several times every day, I go to my machine, and there is always ice waiting without struggling with trays or having to chisel cubes apart. If your kitchen isn't set up to allow a fridge with an ice-maker, this is definitely the next-best option. Of course, with Amazon, you know you're going to get the best, fastest delivery possible.

   "Quiet, fast, perfect, ice maker!"
   This counter top ice maker is amazing! I love that it doesn't require a water line to use! I also love that it is actually very quiet!! It makes the perfect size ice cubes, very quickly!! Another feature that I love is that is reuses the melted ice cubes to make new ones, therefore less waste! If you order this ice maker, you won't regret it!!

   "It is a pretty good filter"
   The "real" problem is that there are a lot of places in the U.S. where the tap water tastes and smells like sewage. This filter takes care of the smell and the taste. However, if your water has a high percentage of calcium carbonate ;which is responsible for: (Lime scale), it will not filter that out of the water. Water systems that use underground aquifers are notorious for having high levels of calcium carbonate. It is hideously expensive for the amount of water which is filtered though.

   "Huzzah!  Calcium deposits and streaks FIXED with PowerHouse"
   I was about to get rid of my old dishwasher because I couldn't stand the calcium deposits and streaks on all of my dishes, but especially the glass and stainless steel.  And then my daughter purchased this from a dollar store, and when I started putting away dishes one night after we'd used it...I was STUNNED.  The glasses were squeaky clean--no white streaks or splotches.  The utensils and cutlery and pots and pans were glistening, for the first time in ages.  I don't know what's in this stuff, but I don't have to use vinegar or any of the commercial "dishwasher refreshers" on the market.  It took care of the deposits that were gunking up my dishwasher and dishes, and I am absolutely astounded at the difference it has made.  Now, I don't have to wipe off or rewash everything before I put them on the shelves.  This stuff is amazing!

   "Wishy-washy dishwasher"
   Updated 8/4/14: I finally got a cleaner load when I switched to Cascade Platinum packets with Dawn!  A couple of times I found an undissolved packet but found if I run the hot water in the sink a few times during the auto cycle there's no problem.  I'm learning to deal with the bad rack design and can load it quicker.  Gave it 3 stars this time.<br /><br />Original post:  I didn't get this thru Amazon because another store had a good sale and they had it installed.  We were replacing a 13 year old Maytag.  I'll just mention that we had problems initially due to the installers not balancing it and when we finally got it adjusted we thought Yippeeee now we can have clean dishes! Nope! So here are some facts about this GE non-dishwasher. And I have pix showing the mess!<br />THE PROBLEMS: The recommended detergent packets don't dissolve leaving a cement hard residue and the gel just slimes everything!  And the dishes are still dirty!<br />WHAT I'VE TRIED:<br />1. Increased the water heater to 125 degrees plus I use the Wash Temp Boost option.<br />2. I've tried all of the cycle options also and still the PROBLEMS persist.<br />3. Due to its poor design, with one of the utensil holders right in front of the detergent dispenser, I spend too much time arranging the dishes and utensil so I'm not blocking it! I hang a lot of utensils from the wine glass holder on the top rack and place very few on the bottom<br />4. Since there are 2 water sprayers for the top rack and just one at the bottom for the lower rack so I have to make sure I don't even put smaller bowls in the lower row close to the detergent dispenser!<br />5. I literally have to soak and wash everything before putting them in the DW.  My next step will be to just hand wash and use the DW as a drying rack!<br />So RIP old Maytag, I wish I could resurrect you!

   "Live alone in a place with a broken full-size dishwasher"
   Apartments...you see a dishwasher built in and think, woo-hoo, no more washing dishes by hand, right?  I don't have a clue what is wrong with that dishwasher other than it deposits rather greasy white streaks on dishes.  I tried CLR, vinegar, and a few other treatments plus talking to the apartment manager and nothing works or has been done to fix it.  I got this small countertop dishwasher and while it may not be as perfect as having a full-size one that works, it DOES work without leaving white greasy streaks on my dishes.  At least I'm not washing dishes by hand every day - this dishwasher works well for me.  It doesn't hold a great many dishes, but as one person, I don't make a ton of dishes.  I'd say this would be great for an older couple or might be good for an RV.  I am happy not to be doing dishes by hand!

   "Worst Dishwasher I Have Ever Used"
   Dishes always have film and food specs, regardless of the brand or type of detergent, rinse aids, vinegar rinses, vinegar in the tub, additives (washing soda, Lemi-shine, Borax) ... nothing helps.<br />My first problem with it was there wasn't enough water circulating. The repairman told me that was not possible, because there was a built in sensor that would tell me if there wasn't enough water. I asked, &#34;What do you have that tells me the sensor is broken?&#34; I had already done a test with an upright cup in the top rack to prove there wasn't enough water even to fill that cup.<br />That repairman replaced the sensor, and at least I was getting water then, but there still were filmy dishes and food specks. I took apart the bottom of the dishwasher and cleaned the gunk out of it that had collected but that was only minimally better. I'm taking it apart and cleaning out the gunk again tonight, because it's making a godawful grinding sound and everything I could find on the Net said that means something is clogged.<br />Even at the best of times, the machine takes forever to run: about 2 hours on Normal, and the Heavy setting is closer to 4 hours. It's quiet (except now, with the grinding) but I'd be quiet too if I wasn't doing anything.<br />This was a complete waste of money, and a terrible frustration. I read reviews before I bought it, thinking this would be a good machine, but out of all of the bottom line apartment dishwashers I used before I owned a home, this ranks far worse.<br />Also, the other reviewers aren't kidding about how easy it is to brush against it and turn the machine on. I had read that before I bought it and thought that was silly, but I should have listened ... it really is annoying.

   "Powerful range hood"
   This is a very powerful range hood. It is rather noisy, but it does its job. It does allow cold air seepage during the winter, which I was not used to as I had had a Jenn-Aire stove with a downdraft vent.

   "Powerful all-purpose hood"
   I chose this hood because I needed a 42&#34; hood that would match my vintage stove.  The almond color matches perfectly, a lucky coincidence considering my stove was manufactured in the 1930's.  Once we hooked it up (an easy procedure), I was surprised at all the convenient features:  a high-speed &#34;boost&#34; button, a sensor that responds to temperature, a sensor to tell you when the filters need changing and easy-to-operate controls.  We chose to use it unvented at this time but we can always vent it later if we decide to ramp up our cooking.  The only downside that I see is that it doesn't include the duct  work for the vent.  However, the duct work is bulky and has to be designed to fit the installation.  There is an adapter for both square and round ducts included in the box.

   "Nice mid-quality vent hood"
   This is a good-looking vent hood.  The fan is pretty quiet given the amount of air it moves, and the lights are excellent at illuminating the stove cooktop.  Build quality is not the best, with air leaks that need to be covered or sealed during installation, and a general slightly flimsy feel to the whole thing.  That being said, no one will ever notice once it’s installed! While it’s not a high-end piece of equipment, it isn’t priced like one, either. Way better than a cheapie vent hood… It works perfectly well.

   "Works Great, But Makes Loud Popping Noises"
   Worked flawlessly for a few weeks, but have had this unit for several months now, and unit makes frequent loud banging or pop noises. Apparently this is normal, and part of the defroster or something. Not very happy because the popping has awakened my wife and I in the middle of the night. I have no other place to put it, or I would move it out of our bedroom, which was the whole reason I bought it in the first place.<br /><br />Other than the noise, the fridge works great, has a lot of room, and doesn't build up any ice in the freezer compartment.

   "Will not hold temperature and is loud."
   Really enjoy the look and space of the refrigerator.  However this thing is loud and runs 24/7.  The temperature is set at 38 degrees and will hold that for a day or two, and then it will be 60 or over the next, and take an additional day to get cold again.  Not sure what is happening.

   "Defrosting again!"
   My GE top freezer GTS22JBPCRWW friege is once again defrosting perfectly, thanks to replacing the old  fan with this one.  This model of GE , I've found on repair sites, has a fan that tends to wear out after several years.  This is a fairly easy repair if you're at all handy with appliance repairs.<br />FYI, if your fridge (at least this model) is cooling and freezing normally, and the defrost cycle is running normally, but you've got ice building up in the freezer, including frozen droplets of water hanging from the top of the freezer compartment  and heavy frost buildup on your frozen stuff - it's probably the freezer fan.  The fan is not running fast enough to evaporate the water, which then refreezes.  This is a very reasonably priced fix for an expensive fridge.

   "Works perfectly in a Sub-Zero 532"
   My 29 year old Sub-Zero 532 freezer section is cooling like new again down to 0 degrees F. This is the second time I've needed to replace the defrost timer as they seem to last about 10 years. Note, it's easy to change but If the freezer or refrigerator is room temperature you will probably need to hold the door closed for an hour or so before it creates a strong vacuum and seals properly. I just place a chair against the door with a protective towel over the back and some weight on the seat. Once everything gets cold, the door gets drawn tight and requires effort to open like new.

   "Great Freezer"
   I got this freezer two years ago . . . what a great buy. It's everything I could have wanted. I have a small apartment and had a small refrigerator/freezer. This is a great add on. Virtually silent. Should be considered frost free, however, after two years I suppose I should defrost it to be the little bit of ice build up off the top. Uses virtually no electricity. I think it's rated at $12 per year. If space is concern, but you want something to keep your frozen stuff in, this most definitely do the trick. When I get Monster drinks from Walmart, they are usually warm. I'll place one in the freezer for about 45 minutes to get it real cold. Hower, I have to set the timer because if I leave it for more than an hour, it will freeze. This freezer gets stuff cold fast.

   It’s a freezer so that’s what I use it for.  When I cook my food that I want to divide and make meals of. My refrigerator freezer doesn’t work it’s not big enough. The disappointment in this freezer is that I knew it wasn’t going to be frost free but I’ve never had one that gets so frosty so fast.  I think this is one will have to be defrosedt every few months rather than every 9 to 12 months like my ones in the past, very disappointing in that part.

We have a small house and I can taste the ozone if I happen to be eating while the washer is on, not pleasant. I wanted love this but it doesn't remove pungent smells. Sweat, pet urine aren't removed, I have to still use detergent or my husband's clothes still reak of BO. It also doesn't remove stains at all.  I have to heavily treat stains. We used it for 3 months, hoping to not have to buy laundry detergent again, but I  can't.  Going back into the box.

   "Easy to set up and the air filters provide a certain level of safety"
   At the start of the cold weather, the dry air took a toll on our skin and it was hard to breathe.  This humidifier helped improve the air quality. We didn't use it throughout the day, just in the evenings to offset the dry air from the baseboard heat.  We didn't find the unit to be noisy, it was barely noticeable.  The humidifier was easy to set up and to refill.  Though other reviewers have pointed out that the filters are relatively expensive, we like that the filters help control the air quality.  Years ago, humidifiers could spread germs through the moist air.  I prefer to have to pay more but to know that the filters are working.

   "Efficient Means to Moisturized Air"
   One of my kids has issues with sinuses and if the air is too dry, she tends to wake up stuffy and with a dry throat. A humidifier is the key to solving this problem and so I turned to this humidifier from Vycol for the relief my daughter needed.<br /><br />With this humidifier, you get digital accuracy and control. This is one of its best features. You can set it for the exact level of humidity you prefer. It will then keep the air at that level of humidity. It has a timer, too, which is good for my daughter. She can make sure it is off when she is not in the room.<br /><br />Another thing I like about this humidifier is that you can visibly see the mist. With others I have used, the amount of moisture added to the air is too slight to visibly see it. With this humidifier, you can see the moisture shooting out from the top. And for a small bedroom, it adds moisture to the air quickly. You need to be careful not to set it too high for that reason. It adds humidity to a room rather quickly and it doesn’t make much noise.<br /><br />A little moisture in the air is necessary for some people. This table top humidifier from Vycol certainly does its job, as promised. You can control it and set it the way you like. It adds moisture to a room quickly and efficiently and it looks better than other humidifiers. It earns an enthusiastic recommendation from me.

   "An easy way to keep track"
   Living in Michigan, humidity is a year-round issue - too much in the summer, too little in the winter. And the problem with both is the changes can sneak up on you until you suddenly realize, hey, it's uncomfortable!<br /><br />I'm using this in the living room right now to alert me to when I need to turn on the humidifier. It will probably move to my basement office in the summer so I know when to turn on the dehumidifier.<br /><br />It's easy to use, intuitive and unobtrusively small. I really like the three display options, too - table, magnetic or wall mount.<br /><br />It takes about 45 minutes after arrival to record an accurate temperature - or, at least it did on a chilly winter day. The product description says it's accurate to  plus/minus one degree, so the 0.8 degree difference between it and another I already had when placed side by side is acceptable. There also was a two percent difference in the humidity, but I'm not preserving fine wine, so I'll call it good enough.<br /><br />It does require two batteries, not one as the product description currently indicates. This would have been annoying if I didn't stay stocked up on batteries.

   We just got this yesterday, and my daughter got a good night's rest up in her loft area. The area tends to get hotter than the rest of the house, and with the heat we've been having, it's been miserable up there since the central a/c isn't cooling it enough. However, if you live in a place that has over 70% humidity, this is not for you. It's never going to get as cold as an a/c, but we don't have a window that opens in the loft area, so we can't vent an a/c up there. I also like that this unit is light and portable.

   "Pretty nice"
   It seems to dry clothes pretty well. It does have a well-intentioned cool-down cycle which takes away that wonderful feeling of pulling out warm clothes from the dryer, but it will help with preventing wrinkles from forming so I understand.<br /><br />Keep in mind that the buttons are on the bottom of the unit, so if you intend to just rest this on the floor like I do, it will be kind of awkward.<br /><br />I recommend getting an &#34;Indoor Dryer Vent Kit&#34; (I use this one: http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000DZFTC6/ref=cm_cr_ryp_prd_ttl_sol_11 ) It will let you vent the damp air out away from the dryer's intake so it will dry a little bit faster.<br /><br />It also apparently has a moisture sensor which finishes the cycle when it's really truly done, or after a couple hours. Sometimes if I overload it, it will take two hours and the clothes will still be damp. Small, frequent loads are highly recommended.<br /><br />I regularly fit 3 pairs of jeans, a couple shirts, a handful of socks and underclothes, and it seems to dry it quite nicely.

   Works everytime. Good for small spaces. Uses regular electric outlet. It takes a longer time to dry than normal size dryers because it only stays on high heat a short time.

Total dry time on high heat is 220 minutes, which I have never had to use this entire amount of time to dry. Holds a nice size load (about 1/2 of normal dryer sized load). Filter is easy to clean and actually has a double filter. Be sure to hand vac the fabric filter occasionally. I love this dryer and it runs quietly. It has made apartment living more convenient.

   "Buy only if you love ironing. The end-of-cycle signal sounds like a child's ..."
   Buy only if you love ironing.  The end-of-cycle signal sounds like a child's toy and is so feeble, even on its loudest setting, that you can't hear it unless you're in the same room and there is no other noise. Furthermore, when the cycle is done, the dryer just stops, rather than continuing to tumble so that the clothes won't wrinkle. There is  &#34;wrinkle care&#34; option that is supposed to keep the drum tumbling for a little while when the cycle is over, but it only turns the drum a quarter-turn once every minute, not enough to stop the wrinkles from setting in. Even worse, the &#34;wrinkle-care&#34; setting inexplicably disables the end-of-cycle signal completely. If you don't want to iron, you basically need to pull up a chair next to the dryer and sit there the whole time.<br /><br />The dryer also has a special cycle to take the wrinkles out of a dry garment using steam. It shoots steam into the drum alright, but also plenty of liquid water along with it. So when the cycle is over, your shirt will be wrinkle-free but will have one sopping wet sleeve, for example.<br /><br />It's pretty clear that LG doesn't have a clue about how laundry appliances are actually used. Avoid this brand.

   "No humidistat built in."
   This is a pretty nice unit, but the big thing it is missing is a (rudimentary) thermostat.  You basically set an analogue style switch as to how much water you want pumped out into the air, but it's really not set-and-forget the way some are: this winter is a perfect example, how in the mid-Atlantic region the outside humidity has changed a lot, and of course you don't need it on when the air is naturally at 40%+.  I am pretty disappointed about that (apparently you can buy an add-on) considering this is a great brand.  Everything else about it is really nice, too (except that it is bigger than some other models that can hold the same amount of water).  That said, it does fill easily and it works well.  It also looks better than most.<br /><br />As usual, you have to change the wicks now and then (you definitely need to dry them out well on the off-season.  You can soak them in a vinegar solution to cull the mold effect.  I tried the wickless types, and they clog my HVAC filter with calcium deposits to the point where it stops working after just two weeks, which obviously makes those types a no-go for my house.  Distilled water works, but is more expensive than wicks over time (perhaps unless you happen to have a still, although it takes time and [electric] energy to distill all the water you will need).<br /><br />Worth a look.

   I purchased this to replace a small portable fan I had for travels.  I have to say I was pleasantly surprised by the amount of cool air this actually produces and it blows out a ways.  The best way to use it, is to put your filter in the freezer after drenching it with water, let it freeze and then put in the unit.  After that, when you are ready to use, put ice in the water tray with the water (make sure not to over fill it).  You can use it with or without the lights,  (makes a great little night light as well).  Also, you can make it spritz the water or use it without the water spritz.  I found this out by accident, so that was a nice bonus.  It doesn't get you wet, just cools the air better.  I am very pleased with this unit, so much I may purchase another for my guestroom.

   I've used portable dishwashers before and they are AWESOME for people who travel or have dietary restrictions (Kosher, for example, need separate washers for milk and meat dishes). The good news is, this actually seems like it does a decent job and even comes with some complimentary detergent and jet dry in the box, so you can get up and running right away... in some cases, at least. I say that because depending on how you hook it up, you may need additional hardware to connect to your water lines and/or sink.<br />Here's my problem with it- they claim it is a "countertop" style washer, but the thing is actually too big for my counter! I don't have enough clearance under the cabinets to fit, and it has a lot of hoses and tubing to connect as well. I was considering drilling into my counter to feed the tubes to the water supply and drain, but decided to try connecting to the sink instead when we saw it wasn't fitting well under the cabinets. But then it is too close to the sink and with the hoses etc connected, it looks like it is taking over the kitchen more than just an appliance on the counter like a toaster.<br />I've seen smaller counter-top dishwashers that would easily fit better in our space. Perhaps this one does a better job, but at this point I feel like it is too big to fit the way I intended to use it, but too small to be one we install permanently in the cabinet space. Perhaps someone else will find this size useful, I'm a little disappointed because I was so excited for this to work.

The ice it makes is the hollow tube type, which is good for making quick ice and quickly melts in your beverage.<br /><br />Setup took seconds, and it's easy to drain and keep ready for the next go round.  It's not too bulky, so you can keep it out on a counter or bar, but that does mean that the compact basket needs to be periodically emptied.  It lacks any form of plumbing, but the water receptacle is plenty big.  If anything I wish that the ice basket were larger to allow it to essentially fill around the same time as the water runs out.  The other quirk is that the ice comes out wet and just barely frozen.  If you put into a freezer, it will stick to other ice and make a block of ice.  As long as I break it up in an hour or so, it stays separated.  These quirks aside, I have no complaints.<br /><br />Highly recommended

   really great, makes ice quickly for when we run out on our fridge. The ice melts fast though, but it makes it fast so can't complain. Couldn't fill a cooler or anything though.

   After 4 years, my old Cuisinart began to have problems with coffee coming out very slowly. I did descale it, but probably not as often as I should have. Before that, never had a problem with it. So, I ordered this new one, and I like it very much, though it does take just a little longer to produce a cup than my other Cuisinart did when it was new, but not a big deal. This one is basically the same as the previous one, but I like that it takes up a bit less space. I do think the coffee is a little less hot than my previous machine, but that doesn't bother me at all. Love that it puts out hot water as well. If it lasts four years like the other one did, I'll be happy...I think that's reasonable considering the two Keurig machines I had didn't even last a year.

   "Great for most things"
   Heating food up and basic cooking has been convenient, though I've only used it a few times so far. It heats up very quickly and puts out a lot of heat. I have stainless steel pots and pans and the heat dissipation is good.<br />I couldn't get a pot of water to boil - it would start to simmer and then the overheat circuit would kick in and turn off the element. Sauteeing is easy but I haven't tried pan or deep frying.<br />I got this to match my red Dash kettle, forgetting the red kettle had died and been replaced with grey, and Amazon accidentally sent me the grey, which worked out great. The unit is attractive, not compact but it's not as bad as other portable eyes I've seen. Once it cools, I just stand it on the side and slide it behind the air fryer, so no loss of counter space.<br />Heat retention isn't huge, but you'll def want to be careful until you know it's cool, there's no "hot surface" light.

   After testing this oven and being completely disappointed, I spoke with the company and they agreed the oven was defective and was not performing properly.  I returned it and got a replacement.<br /><br />It's exactly the same as the first.<br /><br />After heating the oven to 500F, opening the door for just 2 seconds to insert a pizza drops the temperature to 425F.  This wouldn't be so bad, but the temperature NEVER recovers if food is being cooked.  Opening the door again to turn the pizza (the oven doesn't cook evenly...the left side cooks faster) temperature drops to 350F...too low to bake pizza.  Also, Cadco told me temperature recovery should be 10 degrees per minute. No way!<br />With food in the oven it NEVER recovers.<br /><br />FORGET about cooking more than one item at a time...the temperature drops so low it will never cook.  It might even go to zero and freeze it.<br /><br />Our plan was to use this oven to bake 12-15 pizzas per hour.<br />For this much money I am thoroughly disappointed.  This &#34;commercial&#34; grade oven literally can't handle baking one pizza.<br /><br />For $100 I can buy a Wesco pizza oven that fits in my back seat.  The Cadco was supposed to allow us to put out more volume.  Not gonna happen.

   "A Little More Money / A Lot More Convenience"
   We love this great looking oven.  It has easy to use functions.  The convection oven works well, and we love the rapid boil and digital display numbers from 1 to 10 for low to high on the cooktop.  This unit is well made and has one touch buttons for things like pizza, chicken nuggets, preheat, keep warm, etc...  The convenience and money savings of just being to use the top oven without having to heat up the entire unit is a wonderful design feature.  When we cook foods that need completely different temperatures we simply put one in the top oven and one in the bottom.  The number key pad makes it easy to set all functions without having to push an arrow up or down over and over again.  The only minor quirk we have found is the heating elements are on the top of the ovens (traditional ovens have them on the bottom), so you need to keep the food near the bottom or it may burn the top.  The Frigidaire Gallery stainless steel does not smug like many other stainless products.  This is our first Frigidiare product and so far we are very satisfied.  Also, I believe this product is made in the USA!

   "HIgh Power, Low Price"
   I replaced a $1200 Thermador cooktop with a $389 Fridgidare and so far I'm happy that I did.<br /><br />Installation was more difficult that I expected; they didn't bother to install brackets for my previous unit, so I had to install brackets on my granite. I didn't like the suggested method (silicone only) so it added a day to the process to do it more securely. I also had to cut a hole in the wall because the genius installers left the box exposed for the wiring, but there was no way to get to the clamp. Patching that is another project in my future.<br /><br />The reason I like this unit was 1) It was crazy cheap 2) It had a low powered and high powered element in the front, which fits my cooking style. "Quick Boil" is 3000 watts; I do my boiling in an instant pot, but the extra power is useful when stir frying or searing steaks. Even the smaller inside element is 1600 watts. My previous cooktop had 2 1200 in the front and a 2500 and 2000 watt in the rear. You can't stir fry on the rear element easily.<br /><br />I feel like this unit is a bit more "glassy" than my previous unit; a bit more fragile. Time will tell how it holds up.<br /><br />A downside is that I have to re-learn how to cook my favorite dishes, as the settings and power is very different. The Quick Boil element will burn fried potatoes on 3 in a couple of minutes. On the bright side is that the wok heats up in half the time.

I reclaimed some storage options by removing the covers from both bins.  Also, storage of tall beverage containers (e.g., a wine bottle) is always challenging and necessitates constant rearranging of other items and/or shelves. It took me a couple months of experimenting with various shelf heights to come up with an acceptable arrangement.

   I just love this machine.  It has quite a powerful motor on both the washer and dryer.  It also has a very large tub.  No matter how dirty, the clothes always come out clean and in only 15 minutes.<br />  People say if the dryer makes noise it's because the clothes are unbalanced but I find that it actually wants MORE clothes.  When I add more clothes, you can't believe how quiet and powerful the motor is.<br />  I rinse my clothes in clean water going through another wash cycle but with less water and using much less time.  The hoses are very flimsy, so it's best to get maybe a hair washing hose and let the water go into the tub.  I use my washer at the kitchen sink and hook the drain hose in the sink as well.  I just push my dish pan against it to hold it in.  No problems.<br />  I store my machine in my pantry with the hoses in the machine, leaving the washer door slightly ajar.

   "Fabulous little machine!"
   I LOVE, love, love my little washing machine. I can pick it up--even with water in it! It takes more time than a sinble tub and you do have a bit more labor, but the extractor (spinner) removes so much water that the clothes dry very quickly which makes up the time. If you use very little soap--1/2 ounce liquid detergent, I use a shot glass--you can get great results with a 8 - 10 minute wash and one rinse. I would do two rinses, but water pressure is low at this RV park and filling takes a while, but everything is coming out very clean and soft--it’s detergent residue that makes fabric harsh. I have never, ever used fabric softener and rarely use bleach, but my clothes are clean, bright, and very soft. More detergent does not make for more clean. Pre-treat stains and go easy on the soap.<br /><br />I am amazed at how much is washes and love its flexibility. I do dirty jeans and cashmere sweaters--spinning is fine, it’s agitation that causes shrinkage. The wash tub doesn’t have an agitator, but rather rotates alternately clockwise and counter-clockwise like a front loader, so wool is fine--just be sure the wash and rinse water are the same temperature. I hang the clothes in a small room with a space heater and they are dry in as little as two hours for lighter weight garments.

   "Handy, but not comparable to a real washer"
   I live in a small apartment without a washer/dryer, so I depend on going to the laundromat (expensive) or washing by hand (exhausting). This little thing is really helpful. It's much bigger than I anticipated, so it doesn't fit where I would like it to go. My bathroom is small too so it goes in my bedroom. I can fit about half a load of laundry in here. The barrel is big, but don't overfill it or it won't really get washed. I fill it with about 4 buckets of water per wash. I like that I can drain it bucket by bucket instead of it coming out all at once. After it's drained, I'll spin out the clothes. I'll normally have three loads of spins for everything I washed. The spin dryer is really powerful and it comes out almost dry (of course, not completely dry like you would with a heated dryer). Then my laundry goes out on my deck to dry.<br />I had a really hard time understanding the instruction manual since it was written in Chinese and translated to english, but if you have some common sense you don't really need it.<br /><br />Update: I’ve been using this for about a month and it’s still working fine. My issue is that I didn’t think rinsing out the clothes wouldn’t be a big issue, but it is. I need to now go wash my clothes in a standard washing machine because my clothes are so full of soap, dirt, etc. However, after using only this for a month, I’m still impressed that I could get by without a washer for so long.

Total dry time on high heat is 220 minutes, which I have never had to use this entire amount of time to dry. Holds a nice size load (about 1/2 of normal dryer sized load).

   We use this for swimsuits after using the jacuzzi. They spin dry in about 5 minutes and you don't need to hang them up after...ready for tomorrow's use or to let guests leave with their suits dry, in hand. I have used it for some laundry too. But it has a small capacity. I got one bath robe in there. Best for small delicates, and then you still hang dry. Spins 10x faster than machine spin cycle...so it gets more water out, but not 100% dry unless it's sheer materials, etc. Large size, about the size of a kitchen trash can. Wobbles like crazy first 20 seconds if unbalanced, so take a sec and push things down and around bottom. Works great for last 3 months, once-a-day use. I tried using it as a pre-dryer step and it took too long because of the limited capacity. It was like 5 mins x 4 loads, because of capacity. Dryer gets done in 30-45mins one load. Quality product for Chinese made appliance. I'm happy with purchase.

   Heating food up and basic cooking has been convenient, though I've only used it a few times so far. It heats up very quickly and puts out a lot of heat. I have stainless steel pots and pans and the heat dissipation is good.<br />I couldn't get a pot of water to boil - it would start to simmer and then the overheat circuit would kick in and turn off the element. Sauteeing is easy but I haven't tried pan or deep frying.<br />I got this to match my red Dash kettle, forgetting the red kettle had died and been replaced with grey, and Amazon accidentally sent me the grey, which worked out great. The unit is attractive, not compact but it's not as bad as other portable eyes I've seen. Once it cools, I just stand it on the side and slide it behind the air fryer, so no loss of counter space.<br />Heat retention isn't huge, but you'll def want to be careful until you know it's cool, there's no "hot surface" light.

   I bought and returned two of these units. On one of them, setting the temperature to 250, it shot up to over 500F and stayed there. The second unit would not achieve the heat that was set. Set it to 300, it would go to just over 200F, plus when I put my cast iron wok on the second unit, it would give an Error message and not heat at all. I have a Salton induction plate similar to this, which works flawlessly.

   "Efficient Means to Moisturized Air"
   One of my kids has issues with sinuses and if the air is too dry, she tends to wake up stuffy and with a dry throat. A humidifier is the key to solving this problem and so I turned to this humidifier from Vycol for the relief my daughter needed.<br /><br />With this humidifier, you get digital accuracy and control. This is one of its best features. You can set it for the exact level of humidity you prefer. It will then keep the air at that level of humidity. It has a timer, too, which is good for my daughter. She can make sure it is off when she is not in the room.<br /><br />Another thing I like about this humidifier is that you can visibly see the mist. With others I have used, the amount of moisture added to the air is too slight to visibly see it. With this humidifier, you can see the moisture shooting out from the top. And for a small bedroom, it adds moisture to the air quickly. You need to be careful not to set it too high for that reason. It adds humidity to a room rather quickly and it doesn’t make much noise.<br /><br />A little moisture in the air is necessary for some people. This table top humidifier from Vycol certainly does its job, as promised. You can control it and set it the way you like. It adds moisture to a room quickly and efficiently and it looks better than other humidifiers. It earns an enthusiastic recommendation from me.

   "Does well for a small unit"
   I purchased this to replace a small portable fan I had for travels.  I have to say I was pleasantly surprised by the amount of cool air this actually produces and it blows out a ways.  The best way to use it, is to put your filter in the freezer after drenching it with water, let it freeze and then put in the unit.  After that, when you are ready to use, put ice in the water tray with the water (make sure not to over fill it).  You can use it with or without the lights,  (makes a great little night light as well).  Also, you can make it spritz the water or use it without the water spritz.  I found this out by accident, so that was a nice bonus.  It doesn't get you wet, just cools the air better.  I am very pleased with this unit, so much I may purchase another for my guestroom.

   "Water flow decreased significantly, but an easy solution exists."
   Although this filter states it filters more that its PUR counterpart, it does so at the expense of a significant loss in water pressure and thus the speed of flow.  I'm quite disappointed.<br /><br />UPDATE: Ok,  after fishing 6 to 8 gallons through the filter (Whirlpool recommended a 4 gallon flush) no change in flow.<br />BUT, I think I found a solution. I stood the filter upright in the sink and added cold water slowly to allow all the air bubbles to come out.  After a while, all the air was finely out. I reinstalled the filter and the flow is acceptable.

Condensation drying is working well, except for the plastics mentioned by others, which would have melted in the old dishwasher with the dry cycle.  The sanitize cycle helps and only containers I reuse that food came in (like peanut butter jars) can't 'seem to take the heat.  This dishwasher gets my dishes amazingly clean with no pre-washing, and is so quiet I keep checking to see if it's on.  Times have changed since by dishwasher of 1998 and I'm glad!

   "My favorite appliance.  Terrific cleaning, gentle to dishes, energy efficient, quiet operation."
   I am loving this choice.  Installed over a year ago.  Gets near-daily use.<br /><br />The only thing even remotely wrong so far: a modest amount of residual soap buildup, easily solved by occasional use of readily available dishwasher cleaning products, run through as a separate cycle.  Normal for any dishwasher, I guess.<br /><br />This is an energy efficient model without a drying heater.  It does a great job of drying using residual heat after the wash/rinse cycle is done.  Once in a while a few select pieces go into the sinkside rack after the load, to finish drying, but that's nominal.  Most of the time everything is fully dry to the touch and goes directly to cupboard.<br /><br />Tip:  Read the manual and you'll really benefit from this model's features.  Learn:<br />* Which settings to use for different cleaning tasks.<br />* How to silence the beep after the load is done.<br />* Which setting selects advanced dish drying.<br />* When, how to use the Sanitize setting (short answer:  it also promotes better dish drying, so use it regularly).<br />* How to optimally load the system before washing.<br />* How to periodically check the rotary arms and the filters as recommended in the manual.  (So far, only the filters have required occasional rinse out, in my own experience.)<br /><br />This model was an upgrade from what my local appliance retailer normally stocks, but I chose it for its multi-level filtration and other upgrade features:  figuring that, for a few bucks more, you install it, then you live with your choice almost every day of your life for several years, so it makes sense to buy a good performer.

   I'm surprised nobody has mentioned this yet, though I have see a similar review for another model with a similar agitator - the big downside of this model and similar portable washers is that it really manhandles your clothes, meaning the agitator (thing on the bottom that spins) really grabs your clothes and thrusts them in the opposite direction with great force. This results in premature wear of your  clothing. Thin T-shirts I had, had their necks stretched out. and delicate thin wool clothing had holes and tears created in them. Basically if you have any delicate or thin fabrics, they may get damaged, and even if they are not delicate, they will wear a lot faster or get stretched out more than if you washed it in a front load machine.  I am not saying it is much worse than the other portable top load machines here with similar agitator designs. They all probably do the same thing.

   Okay, I worked for Sears as an appliance repair man for 8 years so I know washers and dryers very well.  To everyone out there, if you’re going to by a top load washer make damn sure you get one with a full action agitator.  Otherwise you will be very disappointed unless you only wash delicate non-dirty cloths.  Front load washers do pretty good, but leak and just break down too much, and the cost to keep them up can be heartbreaking.  If you just don't want a washer with an agitator, then your best bet is a front load washer, just do your homework and checkout the reviews and feedback before buying.  Best wishes: Rick Warton

   Buy only if you love ironing.  The end-of-cycle signal sounds like a child's toy and is so feeble, even on its loudest setting, that you can't hear it unless you're in the same room and there is no other noise. Furthermore, when the cycle is done, the dryer just stops, rather than continuing to tumble so that the clothes won't wrinkle. There is  &#34;wrinkle care&#34; option that is supposed to keep the drum tumbling for a little while when the cycle is over, but it only turns the drum a quarter-turn once every minute, not enough to stop the wrinkles from setting in. Even worse, the &#34;wrinkle-care&#34; setting inexplicably disables the end-of-cycle signal completely. If you don't want to iron, you basically need to pull up a chair next to the dryer and sit there the whole time.<br /><br />The dryer also has a special cycle to take the wrinkles out of a dry garment using steam. It shoots steam into the drum alright, but also plenty of liquid water along with it. So when the cycle is over, your shirt will be wrinkle-free but will have one sopping wet sleeve, for example.<br /><br />It's pretty clear that LG doesn't have a clue about how laundry appliances are actually used. Avoid this brand.

   "Excellent Dryer"
   We bought this dryer after first asking for the next model down, the DV330AEW.  This one, the DV331AEW, has "steam technology," which is really just a water connection that allows a fine mist spray into the hot dryer.  Having tried it, I must say it really works.  I have plain cotton shirts that wrinkle a lot, and have always needed thorough ironing after being thru a dryer.  Using the "Refresh" cycle, 15 minutes with a small water (steam) spray, all I had to do was touch-up iron the collars & pockets.  In addition, there is a 90 minute "wrinkle prevent" option that tumbles clothes every few minutes and keeps lots of wrinkles from setting in.  Installation is easy, but still a few comments.  The dryer specification says it is 38.6 inches tall.  (We bought the one without the booster drawer underneath.) Really, with its plastic feet, it is 40 inches.  No big deal?  It was for me, as we had already built a counter that had exactly 38.65 inches clear, so I removed the big plastic feet and put a square of 1/4 inch plywood under each corner.  Samsung furnishes water hoses and a wye fitting to get cold water from the washing machine faucet.  It would have worked OK, but to reduce the clutter, I ran an extra water faucet from the crawl space and up behind the dryer.  The dryer's lint filter is well-designed and has all rounded corners to avoid catching clothes, which had been a real problem with our old dryer.  It also has a door over its lower half, which avoids spilling lint while removing to empty it.  By the way, as many people have already learned, some shopping around gets better prices: the vendor I bought dryer from was asking $859.00

   [[VIDEOID:183e6f4b86bf51e723b3b8b53b9c63ba]] My wife and I love our LG Steam Dryer and Washer units.  Last week the dryer started making a really bad screeching sound and I knew immediately that the drum rollers were going out.  I ordered the Dryer Repair Kit and it came the very next day.  The hardest part of the repair was getting to the back of my dryer since our laundry room is more of an overgrown closet than an actual room.  At any rate I managed to get the 3 screws off the back of the dryer by reaching OVER the dryer while standing on a step stool.  Once the 3 screws come off, the top of the dryer slides off towards the rear.  The rest of the dryer comes apart in a fairly straightforward manner.  I took a lot of Pix with my Iphone just to make sure it went back together correctly.  Once the control panel came off and the door assembly was removed, it was easy to remove the rest of the front panel supports and the drum itself.  I was then able to rotate the remaining base of the dryer since it was much lighter, to get to the rear screws that hold on the mounting plate that holds the 2 rear drum wheels.  Removed all the wheels and replaced them with the wheels in the kit.  Next replaced the idler pulley, and the drum with the new belt.  Re-attached the control panel, front door etc.  Started the dryer and it now runs perfectly!  Saved a ton of money in the process.

I've been VERY pleased with this dryer. . .. . and here's why. . . . . .<br /><br />This dryer has a "window" in the front, like a commercial dryer.  I don't know if this is the "norm" these days or not. . . but I like it.<br /><br />This dryer has a light inside when you open the door.  Again, I don't know if this is the "norm" these days. . . but I like it.<br /><br />"Sensor Dry" works quite well.  Having said that, I HIGHLY recommend that you check the lint filter about half-way through.  All depending upon what you're drying, if the lint filter is full half-way through then you need to remove the lint.  The items will dry much faster this way.  This is especially true with towels.<br /><br />There are lots of different cycles and "extra buttons" to press so that you set your cycle just the way you want it.<br /><br />Granted, I've never had to use this feature. . . but. . . .if you have a problem, there is an app you download, then transfer information from your dryer to the app to troubleshoot the problem before a service technician is called.  Again, I've never had an issue . . . so I haven't had to use this feature. . .but I think it's cool just the same.

   This is a terrific machine. Easy to use it is quick and quiet. You can select different sizes of ice to suit your purpose. Large is great for cocktails, medium for smoothies and blender drinks a nab and small for keeping foods chilled. The instructions are pretty good. The ice is clear and tastes clean. Ice should be removed promptly and a scoop is included. The maker is insulated so it won't melt right away. Melted ice is recycled. It is compact and looks good on the countertop. Nice.

   This ice maker is very easy to use. It makes bullet shaped cubes that are great in blender drinks. It is efficient but a tad noisy. Have had no performance isdues. The self cleaning function is a plus. It is super simple and does a hooid job. The ice does not store in the maker, it mudt GB be removed. Otherwise it melts and the water is recycled to make more ice. The ice tastes good and is chewable if you are into that. The unit is vom pop act and does not take up too much counter space. The ice tastes clean and fresh. There is a handle so this can be transported without fuss. Nice.

   The most impressive thing about this ice maker is the speed in which it makes the cubes, next to that is that you're able to select a size! It is very efficient and even if you have a small kitchen, it is worth the counter space in the summertime for sure. We like to use these for smoothies, cocktails and iced coffees to beat the heat. The price is very good too.

   "Great for most things"
   Heating food up and basic cooking has been convenient, though I've only used it a few times so far. It heats up very quickly and puts out a lot of heat. I have stainless steel pots and pans and the heat dissipation is good.<br />I couldn't get a pot of water to boil - it would start to simmer and then the overheat circuit would kick in and turn off the element. Sauteeing is easy but I haven't tried pan or deep frying.<br />I got this to match my red Dash kettle, forgetting the red kettle had died and been replaced with grey, and Amazon accidentally sent me the grey, which worked out great. The unit is attractive, not compact but it's not as bad as other portable eyes I've seen. Once it cools, I just stand it on the side and slide it behind the air fryer, so no loss of counter space.<br />Heat retention isn't huge, but you'll def want to be careful until you know it's cool, there's no "hot surface" light.

   I just got a sous vide cooker so that I can cook steaks perfectly to my favorite, medium well without the steak ending up tough or chewy.  So having the bagged steak cook a longer time in barely boiling water allows me to "walk away" from cooking.  That being said, at the end of my steak's cook time, I grabbed a frozen corn on the cob and a smaller potato, dropped them both in this container and microwaved them.  After "crisping" my steak, I turned out the corn and potato onto the plate and bam!  Great meal with very little effort!  This container worked well for corn on the cob and a smaller potato.  Next time, I think I will try a good handful of frozen green beans instead of corn and maybe a sweet potato - always worth trying something new!

   I have a multi-use coffeemaker that makes a ton of coffee and tea drinks. It has a frother attachment. I'll heat up the milk  in the microwave in a glass and pour it in the pitcher and froth it.<br /><br />TIP: As a former barista, I know how to make the perfect froth. When using the frother attachment, I move the pitcher up and down until the milk is almost at the top, then carefully pound it on the kitchen counter a few times. As I add honey to my coffee, the frothed milk gets a dense foam. I'll add the froth to the cup, then pour the milk in. You can make the perfect latte or cappuccino by using this method that is even better than any you'll get at a cafe.

   I agree with many of the reviews here but need to add that the lack of an easily accessible lint/hair filter is a real problem with this unit.

I have a cat and the hair creates little lint balls all over my clothes.

   This was the final piece of the puzzle for my non functioning ice maker. I replaced the ice maker itself first. This may or may not have been part of the problem. Next up I determined that the control boards were bad as evidenced by the LEDs not working. No dice or no ice. Last step was to replace the water valve. I removed the old one and discovered that it had five inlet and outlet connections. The new one only has three. I spent a couple of days figuring out in my mind how it all works, and determined that the water first ran through the filter, then to the ganged valves and then the water dispenser and ice maker. The filter was worthless in my view, $35 and change every 3 months or so. No. I re-engineered the system and eliminated the filter. Next problem. The two valve sets are shaped nothing alike, so it was impossible to mount the thing to the frame of the fridge. It now just kind of hangs there supported by the wires and tubing. It does work, and the machine is merrily making ice.

   My freezer is making ice again thanks to this replacement. No adjustments were necessary for water intake. It makes ice better then the original. The ice no longer sticks together as before. One tip is to plug in the power before you screw in the the third lower screw mount, as it restricts the plug from insertion.<br /><br />Before replacing, test the water intake valve as described by the paper clip guy on Youtube. Instead of trusting your luck to the electric tape though, unplug the frig , insert the paper clip, and plug back in. If your freezer has water coming in at the port, your water valve is fine, and you need to buy this replacement. See link below. Another tip is to put a towel in the freezer to catch the water as the water will pump in as long as the paper clip is completing the circuit.<br /><br />[...]

   "Makes great ice, super easy to install"
   Pros:<br />-Makes great ice<br />-Super easy to set up, no water line needed<br />-Easy to fill and clean<br />-Low energy drain (average 70 watts while making ice, 1 watt on standby)<br /><br />Cons:<br />-Loud during ice making<br />-Designed to fit under kitchen cabinets but we tried it in 2 kitchens and it was slightly too tall in both cases (around .25-.5 inch too tall)<br />-Proprietary filter is pretty expensive and I don't expect it to last long based on how small it is<br /><br />If you are looking for an ice maker to give you the 'good ice' you find at many restaurants and fast-food places like Sonic and Chick-fil-a.. from what I can tell this is the only consumer-grade machine that makes true nugget-style ice.  In my opinion the ice this machine makes it not quite as good as that of commercial ice makers because the nugget size is slightly bigger.. but it gets very close at a fraction of the price of a decent commercial machine.<br /><br />My parents have had a manitowoc commercial ice maker for around 20 years now and I have always wanted one myself but was never able to justify spending several thousand dollars on an ice maker.. not to mention the water line and space needed to fit a commercial machine.  So I was excited when I learned about the Opal bringing this kind of ice to a smaller countertop form-factor.  While it isn't perfect, overall I have been happy with the machine and would definitely recommend it to those who are obsessed with 'good ice'.

   "Don't Waste Your Money!"
   We really like nugget ice, so much that we would buy bags of it from Sonic, so we were excited to find the Opal Counter Top Nugget Ice Maker. It was awesome - made great, soft, nugget ice just like it was supposed to - until it didn't. Exactly one year and two weeks after purchase (right after the one-year warranty), it stopped making ice. We tried all of the trouble-shooting - reset it, unplug it and wait a few hours, clean with vinegar, check the water lines. Nothing helped. It will make about a tablespoon of ice and then quit. Disappointing that a $580 appliance is only good for one year (and two weeks). If you want to pay an average of $50/month for the good ice for about a year, go for it. Just don't be surprised when it breaks.<br /><br />Don't be fooled by all of the 5-star reviews. I would have given it a 5-star review as well for the first 12 months. Check out all of the 1-star reviews - plenty of other folks have had the same experience.

   Bought to replace a non working 'upgraded' Keurig that would not work with my SFBay cups from Costco, my favorite coffee.  Lots to like about this machine: the finish, the features, the cool little compartment where the little cup is held, etc..  But the best thing is how strong coffee is brewed.  Crazy but coffee comes out much stronger than in the Keurig, so I only need one mug instead of two every morning.<br /><br />The only downside is that you have to turn it on manually, instead of it turning on automatically when you raise the cup lever.  Other than that 5 stars.

   "Induction with a 30" oven with Air Fry!  Great value.  Loving it more each week."
   Had a Maytag five burner which was a bit older and perfectly working, but showing some sign of aging.  Not too bad though.  Fount this range and had to get it, HAD TO!  . . . and DID!<br />Almost like the Maytag except push button controls instead of rotating knobs.  Meals are done so much faster with better temperature control.  Takes a bit of learning, but not too bad.  Thing to learn first on an induction top it NOT to leave it.  It heats up fast, so stay with it until you KNOW how it behaves.  Will will overcook much less at the beginning.<br />Cooking more and going out less too!<br /><br />I put on a protective coat on the top, which has never been removed as the magnetic field does not know that it is there.  Teflon top cover if I remember correctly.  Bought one other but the heat made it deform too easily while cooking.  It shrinks back to normal, but the expansion is so much that the surface under the cook ware can cause the cookware to not sit perfectly flat.  The other material, teflon, does not have that problem, if I remember correctly.  Cleanup on the top is a breeze.<br />The top cover is sold as a drip bottom protector.  Use on there and clean up, so far, is just a quick wipe off of the material, not the oven itself.<br />Bottom slide out tray is smaller than the old one but adequate.

   "A Little More Money / A Lot More Convenience"
   We love this great looking oven.  It has easy to use functions.  The convection oven works well, and we love the rapid boil and digital display numbers from 1 to 10 for low to high on the cooktop.  This unit is well made and has one touch buttons for things like pizza, chicken nuggets, preheat, keep warm, etc...  The convenience and money savings of just being to use the top oven without having to heat up the entire unit is a wonderful design feature.  When we cook foods that need completely different temperatures we simply put one in the top oven and one in the bottom.  The number key pad makes it easy to set all functions without having to push an arrow up or down over and over again.  The only minor quirk we have found is the heating elements are on the top of the ovens (traditional ovens have them on the bottom), so you need to keep the food near the bottom or it may burn the top.  The Frigidaire Gallery stainless steel does not smug like many other stainless products.  This is our first Frigidiare product and so far we are very satisfied.  Also, I believe this product is made in the USA!

   "I had a very hard time getting it to light, burns pizza on the backside while the front needs more"
   This was my very first time using a pizza oven.  It took MANY tries to get it lit.  After giving up a few times and trying again and again, I did get it lit.<br /><br />It is hard to comprehend but after only 30 seconds you will need to rotate your pizza 180 degrees to help it cook more evenly.  Every 20 seconds might even be better.<br /><br />I got no instructions as how to cook pizza in it.  I had to watch videos and read online about them.<br /><br />Be sure to preheat your oven.  YouTube videos say to preheat it for about 20 minutes on high.  I did this.  I used a infrared thermometer to check the heat on the pizza stone at the front and the back.  There was well over 200 degrees difference on the front and back of the stone.  Is this normal?<br /><br />There has to be a much better design with more even heat.<br /><br />I was very excited to get this.  I went out and got enough stuff to make many pizzas.  I was so underwhelmed with the whole thing that I will probably make my next pizza in the oven.  I can actually see in my oven.  You can’t see the back of the pizza in this pizza oven, so it is hard to tell when it is burning.  Since the front is not done, it can fool you.<br /><br />I am guessing that after this sits around for a while and doesn’t get used that I will give it away.<br /><br />Sorry, this just not live up to my hopes.

   "Nice, semi-portable pizza oven"
   I set this propane pizza oven up on top of a rectangular heat mat to insure my table did not suffer under the heat from this oven.  I have an 11 pound propane tank - easier size for me to carry - and it hooked up easily enough to this oven.  I ended up keeping an infrared thermometer close to measure the heat and the one thing I would change on this oven.  Having a temperature gauge on top that would show me what the pizza oven's internal temp was would tell me when to put my pizza in - I mean, in my kitchen's electric oven, I set the temp to 450 F and wait for it to "ding" when it has reached that temp before adding my pizza.  So that's why I use the infrared thermometer to know when this oven's internal heat is where I need it to cook my pizza properly.  As far as being portable, this oven is a bit too heavy to say it's really portable, but it can be packed for a camping trip if that's what you want.

   "This oven can't handle the heat"
   After testing this oven and being completely disappointed, I spoke with the company and they agreed the oven was defective and was not performing properly.  I returned it and got a replacement.<br /><br />It's exactly the same as the first.<br /><br />After heating the oven to 500F, opening the door for just 2 seconds to insert a pizza drops the temperature to 425F.  This wouldn't be so bad, but the temperature NEVER recovers if food is being cooked.  Opening the door again to turn the pizza (the oven doesn't cook evenly...the left side cooks faster) temperature drops to 350F...too low to bake pizza.  Also, Cadco told me temperature recovery should be 10 degrees per minute. No way!<br />With food in the oven it NEVER recovers.<br /><br />FORGET about cooking more than one item at a time...the temperature drops so low it will never cook.  It might even go to zero and freeze it.<br /><br />Our plan was to use this oven to bake 12-15 pizzas per hour.<br />For this much money I am thoroughly disappointed.  This &#34;commercial&#34; grade oven literally can't handle baking one pizza.<br /><br />For $100 I can buy a Wesco pizza oven that fits in my back seat.  The Cadco was supposed to allow us to put out more volume.  Not gonna happen.

   "Yeah, I'm in love!"
   I got this little oven for use in my motor home. It is small enough to fit out of the way when stored, and doesn't take up serious counter space when in use. I like playing chef while camping in the RV. This enhances that line of interest. I've baked pizza, cinnamon rolls, cookies, meatloaf, chicken wings, oven 'fried' potatoes (excellent), a whole chicken, steak, and hash browns in ramekins (making nests for an egg to bake in). I haven't been 'Chopped' yet - all of it came out very well. The unit is easy to clean. I haven't figured out how to use the wire rest for the power unit yet, but it hasn't been a problem - potholders work great for that. It is money well-spent, in my mind! And it's fun!

   With the skyrocketing prices of Lattes at the coffee we decided to by a home espresso machine and create our own Lattes and Cappuccinos at home.  I watched a lot of YouTube videos to figure out how to properly foam the milk and use a frothing pitcher to deliver the milk properly!<br />The baristas say this style frothing pitcher with its sharp spout allow for a more artistic flair while combining the milk and crème.

   "Part Specs Have Changed"
   This is the part # for our 11 year old GE refrigerator but this auger's measurements are different than the part I was replacing. I had bought another, cheaper auger on Amazon that also had problems with measurements. Other users recommended grinding down the metal rod.  I did not have a grinder so I returned that one. After installing this auger with all my original pieces it was binding some place. Couldn't see where. Auger would manually turn with extreme difficulty. I knew the motor could burn out if I reinstalled the housing it the way it was. I searched YouTube and checked the schematics for this part. My original auger had 2 metal washers plus a plastic spacer at the end closest to the plastic spirals.  Different schematics showed either 2 plastic spacers or 1 plastic spacer; no metal washers I finally found a couple on YouTube that demonstrated the difference in measurements on their auger.  They also had 2 metal washers. He was able to grind down the dent on the rod to allow all his original pieces to fit including the 2 metal washer. I was ready to return this auger as I did not have a grinder. I should not have to be a machinist to get a part to work. Taking a chance I put everything back on the rod in proper order except for the 2 metal washers. Everything works great. Ice cubes come out and cubes get crusher almost better than before.  Have been using for about a week without any problems. Very happy except this took me much more time to figure out than required. Without this issue it would have taken less than 20 minutes for total install and a 5 star rating. Something in the specs for this auger has changed over the last 11 years.

   "Not so compact, but works."
   I've used portable dishwashers before and they are AWESOME for people who travel or have dietary restrictions (Kosher, for example, need separate washers for milk and meat dishes). The good news is, this actually seems like it does a decent job and even comes with some complimentary detergent and jet dry in the box, so you can get up and running right away... in some cases, at least. I say that because depending on how you hook it up, you may need additional hardware to connect to your water lines and/or sink.<br />Here's my problem with it- they claim it is a "countertop" style washer, but the thing is actually too big for my counter! I don't have enough clearance under the cabinets to fit, and it has a lot of hoses and tubing to connect as well. I was considering drilling into my counter to feed the tubes to the water supply and drain, but decided to try connecting to the sink instead when we saw it wasn't fitting well under the cabinets. But then it is too close to the sink and with the hoses etc connected, it looks like it is taking over the kitchen more than just an appliance on the counter like a toaster.<br />I've seen smaller counter-top dishwashers that would easily fit better in our space. Perhaps this one does a better job, but at this point I feel like it is too big to fit the way I intended to use it, but too small to be one we install permanently in the cabinet space. Perhaps someone else will find this size useful, I'm a little disappointed because I was so excited for this to work.

It uses powdered dishwasher detergent or those dishwasher tabs. The capacity is small but it saves you from running the full sized washer. It is portable and ideal for rvs or camping.

   I live alone and rent this house.  I have explained to the owner that the dishwasher does not work but they have no interest in buying a new one and having the old one removed and a new one put in just for me.  This came at the perfect time.  I don't mind washing dishes by hand but nobody wants to wash every dish by hand every day forever and ever.  This mini-dishwasher was easy enough to set up on the counter and while it may not wash but a quarter of the dishes a full size dishwasher can do, but considering I don't make a family's amount of dishes in a day, this countertop dishwasher works fine.  It is easy to use and while it makes maybe the same amount of noise as a regular dishwasher, I can't complain about it.  My dishes are clean when they come out of it and the best part is, I didn't have to wash them!  I am thinking of getting a smaller RV to travel in and think this little dishwasher will probably come with me, I like it so much!

   Pros:<br />-Makes great ice<br />-Super easy to set up, no water line needed<br />-Easy to fill and clean<br />-Low energy drain (average 70 watts while making ice, 1 watt on standby)<br /><br />Cons:<br />-Loud during ice making<br />-Designed to fit under kitchen cabinets but we tried it in 2 kitchens and it was slightly too tall in both cases (around .25-.5 inch too tall)<br />-Proprietary filter is pretty expensive and I don't expect it to last long based on how small it is<br /><br />If you are looking for an ice maker to give you the 'good ice' you find at many restaurants and fast-food places like Sonic and Chick-fil-a.. from what I can tell this is the only consumer-grade machine that makes true nugget-style ice.  In my opinion the ice this machine makes it not quite as good as that of commercial ice makers because the nugget size is slightly bigger.. but it gets very close at a fraction of the price of a decent commercial machine.<br /><br />My parents have had a manitowoc commercial ice maker for around 20 years now and I have always wanted one myself but was never able to justify spending several thousand dollars on an ice maker.. not to mention the water line and space needed to fit a commercial machine.  So I was excited when I learned about the Opal bringing this kind of ice to a smaller countertop form-factor.  While it isn't perfect, overall I have been happy with the machine and would definitely recommend it to those who are obsessed with 'good ice'.

   "Works better than I expected"
   Bought this item to replace a portable swamp cooler, that while it kept the humidity high was a chore to keep clean. It finally died. I've had other wick type humidifiers, but it required more than one unit to keep the humidity at a comfortable level.  Therefore, I didn't expect much, but wanted something that was easier to keep clean. Depending upon how much heat is required in the house (1800 square ft on one level) the humidity stays above 30% and goes as high as 40%. I keep the unit centrally located and close to a return air grill. Something I think is weird is that one of the tanks drains faster than the other, even if I swap the sides. And I do make sure the water drains the same from both. But this hasn't really been a problem. I just keep the faster draining tank on the side that's easiest to put on and take off. I clean the unit as recommended.. It's a lot easier than my old swamp cooler. When I remove the wick for cleaning, I turn it over and place it into a bucket of water to soften up the top part of the wick. I think this greatly prolongs its life. After almost 3 months, I'm still using the same wick that came with the unit.

   So I have had this dryer for nearly a year. It worked well for those months, but now, moisture collects in the bottom of the unit and drips out of the bottom when drying clothing. I have the vent venting into the room, with a dehumidifier going, so humidity doesn't exceed 55 percent. I clean the lint filter between each load. Spin cycle on the washer works; the clothes are only damp when put into the dryer.  Water collects in the venting pipe, I have to drain out between loads. Not certain what's happening, since all of the vents are clear and the ambient humidity is average. I suspect the lower heat compared to other dryers is the culprit. I guess this unit at this rate will last me only a year or a year and a half.

   "Great Freezer"
   I got this freezer two years ago . . . what a great buy. It's everything I could have wanted. I have a small apartment and had a small refrigerator/freezer. This is a great add on. Virtually silent. Should be considered frost free, however, after two years I suppose I should defrost it to be the little bit of ice build up off the top. Uses virtually no electricity. I think it's rated at $12 per year. If space is concern, but you want something to keep your frozen stuff in, this most definitely do the trick. When I get Monster drinks from Walmart, they are usually warm. I'll place one in the freezer for about 45 minutes to get it real cold. Hower, I have to set the timer because if I leave it for more than an hour, it will freeze. This freezer gets stuff cold fast.

   "No frills modern necessity."
   Replaced an old fridge about 20 years old.  The size of the new fridge meets my needs since I am single, and don't need to stock it full for a family.<br /><br />I selected the fridge based on size and energy star rating.  The fridge uses a little over 1 kilowatt per 24 hours.  This is important to me as I live off-grid with solar power, a backup generator, and batteries for night time power.  I find that this new fridge cycles less and is quieter than the old fridge.  In the short time I have had the new fridge in service, it appears to save over 3% of electricity use in a 24 hour period.  This is a huge given that batteries supply the power to it for at least 12 hours a day.<br /><br />I opted out of the icemaker, which increases the freezer capacity by about 25%.

   "if your cheapish chest freezer just quit-try this before getting pissed."
   found a dude online  who's freezer quit and so he tore apart the motor starter to find it was smoked inside.  this is that thing.  it cuts back the amperage to the compressor motor after it starts to save energy and wear/tear.  it is easily replaceable and inexpensive.  it will probably only last 2 years, same as original so i'd suggest to have a spare.

   "So far, so good for this mini freezer!"
   I can’t believe how hard it was to search for a mini freezer.  Whether I used search engines, appliance stores, and especially here, mini fridges are ALWAYS mixed into results.  Finally, I went to the Energy Star website & looked through their recommendations.  I don’t know if I ever would have found this otherwise.  Anyway, I needed extra freezer space in my apartment, and this does the job quite well.<br /><br />Now, if anyone can recommend a 20”x20”x20” cabinet to put under it, my life would be complete 😊

   "Great washer, saving me from visiting the local laundromat"
   I have a small cabin in the mountains that did not have connections for a large washer/dryer...so I bought this smaller machine and dryer to save me from having to go out to the laundromat.  Especially when we get a couple of feet of snow...doing laundry at home is so much better.  It fits everything nicely, even large 'thick' towels.  I have also done CalKing sheets in it too, full set w/ pillowcases at the same time.<br /><br />I notice the machine can get out of balance with heaver/larger items, so sometimes I need to split those up, but in general it works out very well.  No leaking (I have had it about 4 months so far), if it gets out of balance the machine automatically adjusts itself and sometimes I don't need to do anything at all.  I find it re-balances the load better than I can - it is pretty smart - which surprised me the first time it did that!<br /><br />It's a keeper and a lifesaver!  My one gripe is I should have bought the slightly larger version of this machine - I might have been able to get my quilts done in it.  Right now, I will have to still go to the laundromat a few times a year to get larger stuff like that washed.

   "A dream come true"
   I just love this machine.  It has quite a powerful motor on both the washer and dryer.  It also has a very large tub.  No matter how dirty, the clothes always come out clean and in only 15 minutes.<br />  People say if the dryer makes noise it's because the clothes are unbalanced but I find that it actually wants MORE clothes.  When I add more clothes, you can't believe how quiet and powerful the motor is.<br />  I rinse my clothes in clean water going through another wash cycle but with less water and using much less time.  The hoses are very flimsy, so it's best to get maybe a hair washing hose and let the water go into the tub.  I use my washer at the kitchen sink and hook the drain hose in the sink as well.  I just push my dish pan against it to hold it in.  No problems.<br />  I store my machine in my pantry with the hoses in the machine, leaving the washer door slightly ajar.  You cant beat this for apartment washing and smaller loads make it convient to seperate clothing into sweaters, delicates, whites and my granddaughters clothing with all the sequins and all their red Christmas pajamas.  Thank you Della for this exquisite machine.

   "For convenience, affodability, and size, this is a great choice."
   I have purchased TWO of these; one for me and then one for my brother a little later on. For convenience, affordability, and a good fit in a small apartment, this is a wonderful choice. This machine is lightweight; it can be moved and stored easily, and it cleans clothes better than my standard machine. The drawbacks are, for best results only run small loads, it won't accommodate huge items like king-size comforters or quilts, and it does not have a built-in lint trap collection system. However, there are some very inexpensive lint collectors (a couple of dollars) that you just toss in with each wash load that float around on the surface and collect amazing amounts of lint, so that problem is solved. Now that I have owned this machine, I doubt I will ever go back to a standard size (and weight) machine again; this is just too convenient and massively more affordable. ***111

   "A-1, a drop-in replacement"
   Our Kenmore microwave began to start the carousel every time the door was opened.  Scared, a bit of online research turned up the fact that it was only the carousel, and not the magnetron being powered and the likely culprit was one of the door switches.  It was cheaper to replace this, with all three switches on it, than to buy the switches individually.  This is not a repair I would recommend to the non-technical (I'm an electronics tech of 50+ years) but our oven is now running as it should, following some minor installation and an aggravating cover.  (It turned out to be the bottom switch that was the culprit.)

   This is a bare-bones disposal that is working very well.  Installation was straightforward although there was one step that was confusing and has been discussed in other reviews.  There is not insulation around the body of this disposal as there is on many other models but the noise, though noticeable, is not particularly obnoxious nor pound.  We do not use the disposal heavily but for occasional, light-to-medium duty I believe this is an excellent choice.

   "Great slimline range hood"
   I recently converted from an electric range to gas and needed a slimline range hood that could move a lot of air. This product fits the bill nicely. It looks good, works great, was relatively easy to install with a 7&#34; exhaust pipe (they recommend a minimum of 6&#34; for this airflow) and matches the new brushed stainless range very nicely. The lights work surprisingly well too. They use 430 stainless which is magnetic, so I'm assuming that it could rust if left in the wrong condition, yet I have encountered no problems to date. The only downside is that it's a bit louder than I'd like, but for 600 CFM I really can't complain. And, I mostly use the quiet setting which still allows for normal voice conversations whereas on the high setting you pretty much can't hear yourself think. Overall I'm quite satisfied with the purchase.

   "Perfect Range Hood"
   Where to start, the range hood out of the box was impressively stunning in looks, which is not something that is high priority on my list.  Of course I want it to look nice, but I has seen some that are just awesome looking and they turn out to be complete junk.  I am happy to report that this range hood does an incredible job at suction, it's quiet even on the highest fan setting.  The LED lights are not blinding but they provide the perfect amount of light for me.  I love the touch buttons rather than the knobs, much easy to control.  We needed a replacement/updated range hood badly.  Ours was so bad that instead of exhausting like it was supposed to, it would just blow the smoke out everywhere in the house instead of up and out.  It was definitely time for an upgrade either way.  And the price is really reasonable for something this nice that works perfectly.  I highly recommend this one, zero issues so far and we have had it for 3 months going on strong.  I will update with pictures once I can locate the pictures I took.  Hope this review is helpful!

   I love having a refrigerator just for beer! We have half size refrigerator for drinks, but that gets full pretty quickly with water bottles, sodas, and juice. Now we can put the beer and malt beverages in this refrigerator and keep the rest of the drinks in the old one. The glass shelves are very sturdy and easy to rearrange. The older half size refrigerator has plastic shelves and when you put a lot of weight on the shelves, it has shown signs of cracking and bowing. Not the case with this refrig. I have filled it with a mix of beer and sparkling tall/slim cans. I might be able to get a couple more cans in there, but I think it's pretty close to capacity. It's easy to adjust the temperature with the digital display. It's doing a great job of keeping our adult beverages nice and cold.

   "OK Fridge/Freezer, but awkward storage features"
   Overall, a perfectly decent and attractive fridge/freezer.  My major complaint concerns interior fridge storage configuration.  The &#34;covered dairy bin&#34; and &#34;covered storage bin&#34; in either door are quite useless for anything larger than a stick of butter.  I reclaimed some storage options by removing the covers from both bins.  Also, storage of tall beverage containers (e.g., a wine bottle) is always challenging and necessitates constant rearranging of other items and/or shelves. It took me a couple months of experimenting with various shelf heights to come up with an acceptable arrangement.  I wish the left-hand door closed a bit slower -- it's quite annoying to have it crashing into my arm as I'm trying to extricate items from the fridge.

   I have used many a coffee maker, Chemex's, Moka Pot's, French Presses, and Siphon styles. This may not be quite my favorite as the Siphon, but it is excellent. I thought when I got it "This has got to be overhyped, it's just a thick plastic-y thing!" but it really is as good as people say. Looks are deceiving. It is wonderful to use, and dead simple. Put your filter in, put the grounds in, put the water in, stir it a bit, put the plunger on, and plunge. It makes excellent coffee, very full bodied, but still with good clarity due to the paper filter. Absolutely no sediment at the bottom of the cup either! Clean up is a breeze, just take the filter holder off, and pop the filter and most of the grounds out with the plunger, rinse, and it's clean. It's so simple and easy, absolutely zero fuss! I recommend this maker for anyone wanting for a quick and easy to clean maker, or for getting into manual coffee making. It requires very little skill, but it has alot you can do, so you'll never truly master it. I bought one, and recommended it highly enough that a friend of mine did too.

It has great options/features and gets the same job done as heavy duty washing machines do.<br />Love this!

   "Made in China, but so is just about everything else."
   I used this to repair my Kitchen Aid stand mixer.  It works, but I can't use the paddle to knead dough because it bogs down.  I didn't have that problem before I fried the old nylon gear.  At least I can mix pizza dough again.

   We own a expresso machine Breville and we couldn't be happier. My husband is from Europe so he really appreciates a good, good cup of coffee. We realize that you have to take care of this machine like a fine tuned car. With these filters we can assure that the coffee will taste just as good from one cup to the next. Thanks you for sending them in record time.

   "Fast but noisy."
   Although this unit also makes ice cubes at a very fast rate, it is smaller than the unit I replaced, and is noisier.

   "Loud motor"
   It’s certainly not a silent operation when the motor is running. It does not run all the time in comparison if you had a standup freezer the motor would be about twice as loud as this but in the kitchen that is normally quiet this is loud and sometimes can be heard if you’re listening to TV but it shuts itself off. Overall I love the unit and I think it’s wonderful I put it in my kitchen so that I do not have to have a bunch of cans and bottles of soda type stuff in my main refrigerator this way people can only have to go in here I have set up like a snack station or like a concierge lounge in my kitchen and it seems to go over well I would buy it again maybe it needs some WD-40 :-) but no not I am enjoying it and appreciate that it is so compact overall. It was a good purchase and I am not disappointed

   "Quick and quiet!"
   [[VIDEOID:d299dd05005f0dcb2e81ca7c66e0f109]] Excellent ice maker! Makes the ice very quickly and I think it's fairly quiet. It drops the ice a lot more quietly than a built in ice maker in a fridge/freezer.

   "Works great for Instant Pot parts"
   All the small bits on the instant pot fit perfectly in this bag. Put it on the top shelf of the dishwasher, no more lost bits.

   "This works great, I appreciate the security of having thoroughly sealed mylar bags"
   This product is easy to use. Seriously a one button operation. Plug it in, set the dial to the desired seal heat, lay the bag across the pad, push the top bar down. I set it on seven of eight for my bags and it took literally 2 seconds to seal. I used quality, thicker Mylar bags.<br />The bags I used have very good zip closures, but I feel much more confident that the bags won't open inadvertently since they're literally melted shut.<br />The unit is very heavy, and when you use it it smells like a hot iron or melted plastic slightly.<br />Items sealed in mylar bags have a much longer shelf life so I'm very happy to have this unit.<br />It comes with to replacement sets, each includes a fuse, a pad, and a heating element. Clear instructions included.<br />I recommend this.

   "Love this machine, great value!"
   This bag sealer works like it’s intended to. No buttons to turn off or on, just plug it in and it’s ready to go. Heats instantly. Seals my rice paper food bags with no problems at all. Well made and perfectly priced!

   "Easy to use"
   Easy to use....I just found a small cup and then used my mini iron to seal them. They did not take long to seal and used one today and it was perfect. So much better to use my favorite coffee.

   "Works very well for price"
   I have only used this for about 50 bag closures but have been impressed so far for the price. I was also impressed that a replacement seal guard was included. Two small negatives - if you are sealing more than one bag type it is difficult to see exactly where your heat level is, meaning, if bag type 1 seals at about 3.2 and bag type 2 seals at 4.7 making sure the dial is set exactly where you want it is difficult so you’ll need to retest before starting your production. The other small issue is the arm is pretty wobbly.
