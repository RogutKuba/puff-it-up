QUERY: ice maker that doesn't leak water on counter

   "Portable ice maker for your countertop"
   Great ice maker for the money. If your planning a party or just want some extra ice, this will do the job. It does require that you add water to start the cycle and when it's full, you have to use it or bag it, but I can live with that. The only problem is that it doesn't store ice. If the basket has ice in it, and you turn it off, the ice will melt back to water.

   "Makes good ice"
   This machine makes "bar quality" ice very fast. The ice is mostly clear. It drops 9 cubes about every 10 minutes, give or take a minute. It has a good size reservoir for water. You'll get at least 3 bins of ice for every refill. Cleanup is easy. It outpaces my other under-counter bar ice maker; of a well known name, and the noise level is about half that of the under-counter bar ice maker. Ice melt recycles if you do not empty the bin. Which my under-counter model just wastes. It will automatically stop when the bin is full. One word of caution. This goes for every "bar ice type" maker. Do NOT put the ice into your freezer. It will simply freeze into a big wad of ice. If you need to keep a quantity of ice then just put it into something like a styrofoam chest. All of the ice will remain as separate cubes.

   "It locks up several times a day"
   I use gallons of ice each day.  I need an ice maker.  The previous one lasted for two years.  This looked like the same model.  (Frankly, all the stand-alone ice makers look alike.)  One immediately obvious difference: the previous model used a light-beam to detect a full tray; this one uses a thermometer.  Not a huge deal: it notices a full tray a little later with the thermometer.  Then I heard the click-click-click.  The ice scooper was jammed.  I un-jammed it.  Fine.  Now it jams every hour.  When it jams, it turns on the full and out-of-water lights when it is neither full nor low on water.  I don't have to un-jam it, just reset it.  I have a few days to return it.  But I need an ice maker.  (As an aside, the light beam on my previous ice maker should have been modulated on the send-side and filtered on the receive-side so that direct sunlight wouldn't have let it overfill.  Duct tape over the window solved that problem.)

   "WON'T LIVE WITHOUT THIS"
   I live in Las Vegas and drink ice water all day long. I got sick of fighting with ice cube trays. Ice doesn't come out of plastic trays, and the modern version of the metal trays our parents used are so flimsy that they break more easily than the ice they contain. I also got sick of ice in my freezer all solidifying into one massive lump. This ice maker is the perfect answer. I just leave it running around the clock. No, it doesn't keep ice frozen, but when the ice melts, the water goes back in the reservoir and is reprocessed. Several times every day, I go to my machine, and there is always ice waiting without struggling with trays or having to chisel cubes apart. If your kitchen isn't set up to allow a fridge with an ice-maker, this is definitely the next-best option. Of course, with Amazon, you know you're going to get the best, fastest delivery possible.

   "Quiet, fast, perfect, ice maker!"
   This counter top ice maker is amazing! I love that it doesn't require a water line to use! I also love that it is actually very quiet!! It makes the perfect size ice cubes, very quickly!! Another feature that I love is that is reuses the melted ice cubes to make new ones, therefore less waste! If you order this ice maker, you won't regret it!!

   "It is a pretty good filter"
   The "real" problem is that there are a lot of places in the U.S. where the tap water tastes and smells like sewage. This filter takes care of the smell and the taste. However, if your water has a high percentage of calcium carbonate ;which is responsible for: (Lime scale), it will not filter that out of the water. Water systems that use underground aquifers are notorious for having high levels of calcium carbonate. It is hideously expensive for the amount of water which is filtered though.

   "Huzzah!  Calcium deposits and streaks FIXED with PowerHouse"
   I was about to get rid of my old dishwasher because I couldn't stand the calcium deposits and streaks on all of my dishes, but especially the glass and stainless steel.  And then my daughter purchased this from a dollar store, and when I started putting away dishes one night after we'd used it...I was STUNNED.  The glasses were squeaky clean--no white streaks or splotches.  The utensils and cutlery and pots and pans were glistening, for the first time in ages.  I don't know what's in this stuff, but I don't have to use vinegar or any of the commercial "dishwasher refreshers" on the market.  It took care of the deposits that were gunking up my dishwasher and dishes, and I am absolutely astounded at the difference it has made.  Now, I don't have to wipe off or rewash everything before I put them on the shelves.  This stuff is amazing!

   "Wishy-washy dishwasher"
   Updated 8/4/14: I finally got a cleaner load when I switched to Cascade Platinum packets with Dawn!  A couple of times I found an undissolved packet but found if I run the hot water in the sink a few times during the auto cycle there's no problem.  I'm learning to deal with the bad rack design and can load it quicker.  Gave it 3 stars this time.<br /><br />Original post:  I didn't get this thru Amazon because another store had a good sale and they had it installed.  We were replacing a 13 year old Maytag.  I'll just mention that we had problems initially due to the installers not balancing it and when we finally got it adjusted we thought Yippeeee now we can have clean dishes! Nope! So here are some facts about this GE non-dishwasher. And I have pix showing the mess!<br />THE PROBLEMS: The recommended detergent packets don't dissolve leaving a cement hard residue and the gel just slimes everything!  And the dishes are still dirty!<br />WHAT I'VE TRIED:<br />1. Increased the water heater to 125 degrees plus I use the Wash Temp Boost option.<br />2. I've tried all of the cycle options also and still the PROBLEMS persist.<br />3. Due to its poor design, with one of the utensil holders right in front of the detergent dispenser, I spend too much time arranging the dishes and utensil so I'm not blocking it! I hang a lot of utensils from the wine glass holder on the top rack and place very few on the bottom<br />4. Since there are 2 water sprayers for the top rack and just one at the bottom for the lower rack so I have to make sure I don't even put smaller bowls in the lower row close to the detergent dispenser!<br />5. I literally have to soak and wash everything before putting them in the DW.  My next step will be to just hand wash and use the DW as a drying rack!<br />So RIP old Maytag, I wish I could resurrect you!

   "Live alone in a place with a broken full-size dishwasher"
   Apartments...you see a dishwasher built in and think, woo-hoo, no more washing dishes by hand, right?  I don't have a clue what is wrong with that dishwasher other than it deposits rather greasy white streaks on dishes.  I tried CLR, vinegar, and a few other treatments plus talking to the apartment manager and nothing works or has been done to fix it.  I got this small countertop dishwasher and while it may not be as perfect as having a full-size one that works, it DOES work without leaving white greasy streaks on my dishes.  At least I'm not washing dishes by hand every day - this dishwasher works well for me.  It doesn't hold a great many dishes, but as one person, I don't make a ton of dishes.  I'd say this would be great for an older couple or might be good for an RV.  I am happy not to be doing dishes by hand!

   "Worst Dishwasher I Have Ever Used"
   Dishes always have film and food specs, regardless of the brand or type of detergent, rinse aids, vinegar rinses, vinegar in the tub, additives (washing soda, Lemi-shine, Borax) ... nothing helps.<br />My first problem with it was there wasn't enough water circulating. The repairman told me that was not possible, because there was a built in sensor that would tell me if there wasn't enough water. I asked, &#34;What do you have that tells me the sensor is broken?&#34; I had already done a test with an upright cup in the top rack to prove there wasn't enough water even to fill that cup.<br />That repairman replaced the sensor, and at least I was getting water then, but there still were filmy dishes and food specks. I took apart the bottom of the dishwasher and cleaned the gunk out of it that had collected but that was only minimally better. I'm taking it apart and cleaning out the gunk again tonight, because it's making a godawful grinding sound and everything I could find on the Net said that means something is clogged.<br />Even at the best of times, the machine takes forever to run: about 2 hours on Normal, and the Heavy setting is closer to 4 hours. It's quiet (except now, with the grinding) but I'd be quiet too if I wasn't doing anything.<br />This was a complete waste of money, and a terrible frustration. I read reviews before I bought it, thinking this would be a good machine, but out of all of the bottom line apartment dishwashers I used before I owned a home, this ranks far worse.<br />Also, the other reviewers aren't kidding about how easy it is to brush against it and turn the machine on. I had read that before I bought it and thought that was silly, but I should have listened ... it really is annoying.

   I chose this hood because I needed a 42&#34; hood that would match my vintage stove.  The almond color matches perfectly, a lucky coincidence considering my stove was manufactured in the 1930's.  Once we hooked it up (an easy procedure), I was surprised at all the convenient features:  a high-speed &#34;boost&#34; button, a sensor that responds to temperature, a sensor to tell you when the filters need changing and easy-to-operate controls.  We chose to use it unvented at this time but we can always vent it later if we decide to ramp up our cooking.  The only downside that I see is that it doesn't include the duct  work for the vent.  However, the duct work is bulky and has to be designed to fit the installation.  There is an adapter for both square and round ducts included in the box.

   "Nice mid-quality vent hood"
   This is a good-looking vent hood.  The fan is pretty quiet given the amount of air it moves, and the lights are excellent at illuminating the stove cooktop.  Build quality is not the best, with air leaks that need to be covered or sealed during installation, and a general slightly flimsy feel to the whole thing.  That being said, no one will ever notice once it’s installed! While it’s not a high-end piece of equipment, it isn’t priced like one, either. Way better than a cheapie vent hood… It works perfectly well.

   "Compact and Convenient Dishwasher"
   This is an excellent compact dishwasher that is perfect for a small space. It is about the size of a large microwave. I found that it is light enough for one person to maneuver, but it's easier with two people. It has a good capacity for such a compact unit. It's easy to operate and comes with a power cord and connection hoses. It's likely that you'll have to purchase an additional adapter to fit your faucet.<br /><br />The dishwasher looks nice and operates with minimal noise.

   "Not so compact, but works."
   I've used portable dishwashers before and they are AWESOME for people who travel or have dietary restrictions (Kosher, for example, need separate washers for milk and meat dishes). The good news is, this actually seems like it does a decent job and even comes with some complimentary detergent and jet dry in the box, so you can get up and running right away... in some cases, at least. I say that because depending on how you hook it up, you may need additional hardware to connect to your water lines and/or sink.<br />Here's my problem with it- they claim it is a "countertop" style washer, but the thing is actually too big for my counter! I don't have enough clearance under the cabinets to fit, and it has a lot of hoses and tubing to connect as well. I was considering drilling into my counter to feed the tubes to the water supply and drain, but decided to try connecting to the sink instead when we saw it wasn't fitting well under the cabinets. But then it is too close to the sink and with the hoses etc connected, it looks like it is taking over the kitchen more than just an appliance on the counter like a toaster.<br />I've seen smaller counter-top dishwashers that would easily fit better in our space. Perhaps this one does a better job, but at this point I feel like it is too big to fit the way I intended to use it, but too small to be one we install permanently in the cabinet space. Perhaps someone else will find this size useful, I'm a little disappointed because I was so excited for this to work.

   Really like the ease of making ice.  Once the unit is on and the refrigeration is cold, ice makes pretty fast.  The unit will stop making ice once the basket is filled, but once ice is removed it starts up.  As a kick start I made ice and bagged it in my home freezer.

#4 [★★★★★]  (sim: 0.676)
   "Makes great ice fast"
   Our icemaker in our freezer just doesn't want to work, and making ice the old fashioned way gets old.  This allows us to either make ice on demand or make a bunch and keep in the freezer (we tend to do both--make ice when needed and make extra for in between).  The ice it makes is the hollow tube type, which is good for making quick ice and quickly melts in your beverage.<br /><br />Setup took seconds, and it's easy to drain and keep ready for the next go round.  It's not too bulky, so you can keep it out on a counter or bar, but that does mean that the compact basket needs to be periodically emptied.  It lacks any form of plumbing, but the water receptacle is plenty big.  If anything I wish that the ice basket were larger to allow it to essentially fill around the same time as the water runs out.  The other quirk is that the ice comes out wet and just barely frozen.  If you put into a freezer, it will stick to other ice and make a block of ice.  As long as I break it up in an hour or so, it stays separated.  These quirks aside, I have no complaints.<br /><br />Highly recommended

   This dishwasher is doing an excellent job for us.  I too was used to a dishwasher with a &#34;drying element&#34;, however I had turned it off due to the extreme energy usage.  Condensation drying is working well, except for the plastics mentioned by others, which would have melted in the old dishwasher with the dry cycle.  The sanitize cycle helps and only containers I reuse that food came in (like peanut butter jars) can't 'seem to take the heat.  This dishwasher gets my dishes amazingly clean with no pre-washing, and is so quiet I keep checking to see if it's on.  Times have changed since by dishwasher of 1998 and I'm glad!  I would recommend this unit and would buy it again.

   "My favorite appliance.  Terrific cleaning, gentle to dishes, energy efficient, quiet operation."
   I am loving this choice.  Installed over a year ago.  Gets near-daily use.<br /><br />The only thing even remotely wrong so far: a modest amount of residual soap buildup, easily solved by occasional use of readily available dishwasher cleaning products, run through as a separate cycle.  Normal for any dishwasher, I guess.<br /><br />This is an energy efficient model without a drying heater.  It does a great job of drying using residual heat after the wash/rinse cycle is done.  Once in a while a few select pieces go into the sinkside rack after the load, to finish drying, but that's nominal.  Most of the time everything is fully dry to the touch and goes directly to cupboard.<br /><br />Tip:  Read the manual and you'll really benefit from this model's features.  Learn:<br />* Which settings to use for different cleaning tasks.<br />* How to silence the beep after the load is done.<br />* Which setting selects advanced dish drying.<br />* When, how to use the Sanitize setting (short answer:  it also promotes better dish drying, so use it regularly).<br />* How to optimally load the system before washing.<br />* How to periodically check the rotary arms and the filters as recommended in the manual.  (So far, only the filters have required occasional rinse out, in my own experience.)<br /><br />This model was an upgrade from what my local appliance retailer normally stocks, but I chose it for its multi-level filtration and other upgrade features:  figuring that, for a few bucks more, you install it, then you live with your choice almost every day of your life for several years, so it makes sense to buy a good performer.  This model is.

   "Amazing small dishwasher - so quiet!"
   We use this as a second dishwasher for our cat dishes. It is quiet and gets the dishes really clean. We are a Danby repeat customer and I can highly recommend their dishwashers. This little dishwasher holds a surprising amount of dishes. I have to say again, it is very, very quiet. Our old Danby from 2004 was an 18" portable and sounded like a thunderstorm. But worked superbly for years. We are even more pleased with this new one.

   "poor performer"
   as some others have indicated, this dishwasher seems to do very little, if anything, in the way of actually cleaning dishes.  :(  i don't mind the noise level a bit; i guess i grew up with noisier dishwashers than some people did. but running it at all is kind of pointless if it's not going to get the dishes clean.

   "Makes great ice, super easy to install"
   Pros:<br />-Makes great ice<br />-Super easy to set up, no water line needed<br />-Easy to fill and clean<br />-Low energy drain (average 70 watts while making ice, 1 watt on standby)<br /><br />Cons:<br />-Loud during ice making<br />-Designed to fit under kitchen cabinets but we tried it in 2 kitchens and it was slightly too tall in both cases (around .25-.5 inch too tall)<br />-Proprietary filter is pretty expensive and I don't expect it to last long based on how small it is<br /><br />If you are looking for an ice maker to give you the 'good ice' you find at many restaurants and fast-food places like Sonic and Chick-fil-a.. from what I can tell this is the only consumer-grade machine that makes true nugget-style ice.  In my opinion the ice this machine makes it not quite as good as that of commercial ice makers because the nugget size is slightly bigger.. but it gets very close at a fraction of the price of a decent commercial machine.<br /><br />My parents have had a manitowoc commercial ice maker for around 20 years now and I have always wanted one myself but was never able to justify spending several thousand dollars on an ice maker.. not to mention the water line and space needed to fit a commercial machine.  So I was excited when I learned about the Opal bringing this kind of ice to a smaller countertop form-factor.  While it isn't perfect, overall I have been happy with the machine and would definitely recommend it to those who are obsessed with 'good ice'.

   "Don't Waste Your Money!"
   We really like nugget ice, so much that we would buy bags of it from Sonic, so we were excited to find the Opal Counter Top Nugget Ice Maker. It was awesome - made great, soft, nugget ice just like it was supposed to - until it didn't. Exactly one year and two weeks after purchase (right after the one-year warranty), it stopped making ice. We tried all of the trouble-shooting - reset it, unplug it and wait a few hours, clean with vinegar, check the water lines. Nothing helped. It will make about a tablespoon of ice and then quit. Disappointing that a $580 appliance is only good for one year (and two weeks). If you want to pay an average of $50/month for the good ice for about a year, go for it. Just don't be surprised when it breaks.<br /><br />Don't be fooled by all of the 5-star reviews. I would have given it a 5-star review as well for the first 12 months. Check out all of the 1-star reviews - plenty of other folks have had the same experience.

   "Ice, Ice, Baby"
   This is a terrific machine. Easy to use it is quick and quiet. You can select different sizes of ice to suit your purpose. Large is great for cocktails, medium for smoothies and blender drinks a nab and small for keeping foods chilled. The instructions are pretty good. The ice is clear and tastes clean. Ice should be removed promptly and a scoop is included. The maker is insulated so it won't melt right away. Melted ice is recycled. It is compact and looks good on the countertop. Nice.

   "Not so compact, but works."
   I've used portable dishwashers before and they are AWESOME for people who travel or have dietary restrictions (Kosher, for example, need separate washers for milk and meat dishes). The good news is, this actually seems like it does a decent job and even comes with some complimentary detergent and jet dry in the box, so you can get up and running right away... in some cases, at least. I say that because depending on how you hook it up, you may need additional hardware to connect to your water lines and/or sink.<br />Here's my problem with it- they claim it is a "countertop" style washer, but the thing is actually too big for my counter! I don't have enough clearance under the cabinets to fit, and it has a lot of hoses and tubing to connect as well. I was considering drilling into my counter to feed the tubes to the water supply and drain, but decided to try connecting to the sink instead when we saw it wasn't fitting well under the cabinets. But then it is too close to the sink and with the hoses etc connected, it looks like it is taking over the kitchen more than just an appliance on the counter like a toaster.<br />I've seen smaller counter-top dishwashers that would easily fit better in our space. Perhaps this one does a better job, but at this point I feel like it is too big to fit the way I intended to use it, but too small to be one we install permanently in the cabinet space. Perhaps someone else will find this size useful, I'm a little disappointed because I was so excited for this to work.

   "Wonderful"
   This portable dishwasher is amazing. Perfect for small spaces it is simple to set up and use. It does a terrific job. There are a number of settings: normal, rapid, fruit, steam and glass. ,The fruit option insures your produce is free of dirt. No detergent needed for this cycle.  It uses powdered dishwasher detergent or those dishwasher tabs. The capacity is small but it saves you from running the full sized washer. It is portable and ideal for rvs or camping. My kitchen isa disaster due to a pandemic interrupted andcpostponed rennovation. This countertop appliance makes life easier.

   "Say bye bye to hand washing dishes"
   If you are living in an apartment and don't have a dishwasher you might want to check this out. This is designed to sit on the countertop, draws its water source from the faucet via a included hose, and drains into the sink via provided hose. It plugs into a regular 110v outlet.<br /><br />This unit also has a fruits and veg washing setting which I found pretty interesting!  Remember to clean your filter each use.<br /><br />I wl update as the appliance gets more use

   "Compact and Convenient Dishwasher"
   This is an excellent compact dishwasher that is perfect for a small space. It is about the size of a large microwave. I found that it is light enough for one person to maneuver, but it's easier with two people. It has a good capacity for such a compact unit. It's easy to operate and comes with a power cord and connection hoses. It's likely that you'll have to purchase an additional adapter to fit your faucet.<br /><br />The dishwasher looks nice and operates with minimal noise. The item comes securely packaged in Styrofoam to ensure it will arrive in good working order. This is a convenient and practical dishwasher for a small living space.

   "The full size dishwasher in my home quit working"
   I live alone and rent this house.  I have explained to the owner that the dishwasher does not work but they have no interest in buying a new one and having the old one removed and a new one put in just for me.  This came at the perfect time.  I don't mind washing dishes by hand but nobody wants to wash every dish by hand every day forever and ever.  This mini-dishwasher was easy enough to set up on the counter and while it may not wash but a quarter of the dishes a full size dishwasher can do, but considering I don't make a family's amount of dishes in a day, this countertop dishwasher works fine.  It is easy to use and while it makes maybe the same amount of noise as a regular dishwasher, I can't complain about it.  My dishes are clean when they come out of it and the best part is, I didn't have to wash them!  I am thinking of getting a smaller RV to travel in and think this little dishwasher will probably come with me, I like it so much!

   I was using the branded product in my refrigerator water filter, and the water tasted just fine.

I do think it is worthwhile to pay a little bit more for the higher end filtration, as I do notice a taste difference.

   This is a great addition to any kitchen, especially if you don't have an ice-maker in the freezer. Setting it up is simple, as is the initial cleaning (it mostly self-cleans). The ice it produces is perfect: smaller, cylindrical cubes that are not overly-solid. It is like the ice you would find at Sonic and some other fast food places. It makes ice quickly and always keeps the drawer full. It's just great.
